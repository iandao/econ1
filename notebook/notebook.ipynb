Alongside the numerous human losses and injuries being suffered during the operation, governmental and international organisations working in Gaza have reported considerable damage to infrastructure and economic loss. The destruction of power, water, health, education and other service facilities poses severe challenges to the already vulnerable economy of Gaza. of up to 40% of its total needs.1announced they were no longer able to guarantee the provision of electricity for even 8 hours a day.2 At the time of going to print, electricity blackouts around Gaza were reported to have reached up to 12 hours per day on average.3 In central Gaza and Khan Younis, reports indicated that cuts lasting approximately 15 hours per day were affecting around 400,000 people. The situation had become more severe following damage to six out of the ten high tension power lines running from Israel into Gaza. As reported by Gisha, this left hundreds of thousands of people completely without power, while hundreds of thousands more were merely receiving between 2-5 hours of electricity per day.4The water supply situation was reported to be equally critical. According to OCHA, damage to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities resulted in much lower than normal levels of water being supplied to the population.5 As the Bulletin went to print, it was estimated that 1.2 million people had very limited or no access to water or sanitation services due to damage to the electricity system or lack of fuel to run generators to power WASH facilities. At the same time, several areas were General economic activity was reported to have been virtually paralysed since the beginning of the operation, as most businesses remained closed. At the time of going to press, activity in the crossings in and out of Gaza was reported to be largely limited to the passage of humanitarian aid, emergency assistance goods (including fuel and food), medical evacuations and other exceptional cases. At herders were in need of animal feed for their livestock, and severe damage to agricultural holdings had been reported - including the partial or total destruction of 58 dunums of green houses and 1,230 dunums of orchards and vegetables. As farmers were unable to access their land, around 2,000 cultivated dunums of irrigated vegetables were at risk of drought and loss.6As hospitals began to run out of essential medicine stocks and more displaced families seek shelter in UNRWA facilities, the UN organisation launched a $60m emergency appeal to continue its activities in response to the humanitarian crisis during the coming months.71 www.palthink.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Policy-Paper-Electricity-Crisis-in-Gaza.pdf2 www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=7088973 www.gisha.org/updates/30184 www.gisha.org/updates/30855 www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_sitrep_22_07_2014.pdf6 www.bit.ly/1lz6PAM and www.bit.ly/1lz70w87The IMF published a report assessing recent macroeconomic developments in Palestine and providing forecastsIn Q1 2014 Palestinian quarterly GDP decreased by 0.6% in real terms with respect to the previous quarterIn Q1 2014 the current $418.5m, increasing by 14.6% with respect to the previous quarter and by more than 70% from Q1 2013Preliminary results of the 2013 annual food security survey show that 33% of Palestinian households are food insecure The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

The challenging conditions derived from the long term restrictions imposed on Gaza by the government of Israel have led to structural economic stagnation and a continuous deterioration of the living standards. As reported by UNRWA, the number of Palestinian refugees relying on food aid has increased from less than 80,000 in 2000 to over 830,000 today. The grave humanitarian consequences following the recent escalation in Gaza are likely to further deteriorate food security standards and have long-lasting impact on its population.  EntrepreneurshipThe fourth Startup Weekend Gaza (SWG) took place on 19-21 June.15 Despite the relatively small start-up scene in Gaza, 150 companies were selected to participate in the hands-on web and mobile technology event from among 650 applicants, marking the largest-to-date event of its kind in Gaza.16 As such, SWG demonstrates the existence of a young, vibrant community committed to working for a better living through innovation and creative thinking.  In Gaza, women and youth are taking the lead in the entrepreneurship scene. This phenomenon could result in tangible improvements for such marginalised population segments if conditions for the sustainable development of the sector are promoted. More than half of SWG participants were female and the youngest participants were 14 and 16 years old. 15 www.gaza.startupweekend.org/16 www.wamda.com/2014/06/startup-weekend-gaza-4-turning-point-ecosystem\n",

Formed of independent technocrats, the new government is tasked with the mission of preparing for national elections (intended to be held within the next six months) and integrating West Bank and Gaza institutions, following seven years of internal political division. Four of the newly appointed government ministers are residents from Gaza. Dr Rami Hamdallah, an academic and university president, was re-appointed as Prime Minister of the new technocratic government, after having served as the Prime Minister of the PNA since June 2013. Of the 16 ministers under him about half were members of the previous PNA government, including Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, Dr Mohammad Mustafa, who has also been appointed as the new government´s Minister of National Economy. Dr Mustafa is also currently the Chairman of the Palestine Investment Fund (PIF), which he joined as CEO in 2005. Shukri Bishara, who has served as the PNA Minister of Finance since mid-2013, will be responsible for both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning under the new government. With extensive private sector experience, Mr Bishara served as CEO of the Housing Bank for Trade & Finance, and held several positions at the Arab Bank between 1979 and 2006, when he was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of the PIF.School to Work TransitionThe Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics announced the main results of the Youth Transition from School to Work Survey 2013, conducted in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO). The survey, part of ILO™s Work4Youth Project, was carried out in 28 countries around the world.Findings indicate that the majority of Palestinian youth struggle to successfully which the ILO argues is one of the main causes of long-term unemployment.1Survey results show that in 2013 only 23% of young Palestinians completed their transition from education to stable or satisfactory employment. At the same time, nearly half of young graduates had not started their transition, and around 32% remained ﬁin transitionﬂ. The education-to-employment transitional period was stable job after the completion of studies. The survey also suggests that the opportunities available in the Palestinian labour market require relatively low skill levels. Consequently, better educated data shows that the highest youth unemployment rates were registered among (75.4% in total Œ 67.1% among males and 83.5% among females).1 www.bit.ly/UTCff5The results of the Youth Transition from School to Work Survey indicate that the majority of Palestinian youth struggle to successfully move from education to employmentIn mid-May the Bank of Israel banned Palestinian commercial banks from making deposits of shekels in Israeli banksThe US Senate approved a $48.3bn State and Foreign Operations bill that included cuts in total aid funding to PalestineThe IFC announced an investment of up to $3m in the Palestine Growth Capital Fund, a Palestinian private equity fundForum discussed the challenges facing the water sector, focusing on the water and energy nexus and the role of the private sectorThe Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

As the Bulletin went to print, Gisha reported that Israel had ordered further restrictions on movement at Gaza™s crossings.18 There is an urgent need to enable major construction projects in Gaza, as the sector contributes roughly a quarter of Gaza™s GDP and remains an important source of employment for Gazan workers. The recent sharp rise in total unemployment in Gaza (which reached 41% in Q1 2014, up from 31% in Q1 2013) was largely driven by a loss of around 12,500 jobs in the construction sector. As a result, construction™s share of total employment in Gaza decreased from 6.9% in Q1 2013 to 2.2% in Q1 2014.19May PEX TradingDuring most of May the Al-Quds index continued its downward trend, although it partially recovered towards the end of the month.

Of the total, only 42 licenses (0.02%) were issued for construction in Gaza.Construction activities in Gaza remain severely affected by the long-standing restrictions on the entrance of construction materials from Israel and Egypt. The closure of most trade tunnels between Gaza and Egypt between 2012 and 2013 left the Karm Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing, connecting Gaza to Israel, as the main passage for the transfer of goods into and out of the Strip. Since the last quarter of 2013 restrictions on the entrance of several construction projects have been frozen as a result of the shortage. There are currently only 81 active projects in Gaza, all of them funded either by Qatar or international organisations (in addition to 27 UNRWA projects).16June 2014 Israel permitted the entrance of construction materials for a number of projects implemented by the UN, after having banned the passage of all construction materials, whether for international organisations or the private sector, from October 2013.17 As of 16 June other construction materials were reported to be entering in 15 www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_PCBS/Downloads/book2054.pdf16 www.gisha.org/en-blog/2014/06/12/building-in-ruins/17 www.gisha.org/UserFiles/File/publications/Info_Gaza_Eng.pdf\n",

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 105June 2015Exports from GazaIn May 2015, 118 truckloads of goods left Gaza, marking the highest monthly trade level on record since the beginning of the blockade imposed by Israel in 2007. Of the total traded from Gaza in May, 61 truckloads were exports to Israel (39) and other international markets (22), while the rest was marketed in the West Bank.1 The increase comes as a result of some relaxation on restrictions to the exit of goods from Gaza by the Government of Israel (GoI), which since November 2014 has allowed the sale of certain Gaza-made products in the West Bank. More recently, from March 2015, the GoI has allowed the entry of agricultural products from Gaza into Israel, following a complete ban since 2007. Between 8 March and 11 June (latest available data), 102 truckloads of tomatoes and eggplants (equalling almost 1,400 tons) were exported from Gaza to Israel.2While increased trade from Gaza is undoubtedly a positive development, recent allowed out of Gaza is only a negligible portion of the trade level observed prior to the blockade.    Data from UNOCHA (Figure 1) shows that exports from Gaza dropped from 15,255 truckloads in 2000 to as little as 136 truckloads in 2014.3 A sharp decrease was immediately observed after the beginning of the blockade, with merely 33 truckloads of goods leaving Gaza in 2008. Average monthly exports in 2014 (11.3 truckloads) amounted to just 0.9% of the monthly average in 2000. Even if the upward trend observed over the last few months is sustained during the rest of 2015, the average number of monthly truckloads is unlikely to exceed 3% of the 2000 level.Figure 1: Exports from Gaza, 2000-2015* (Truckloads)2000    2001    2002    2003    2004   2005   2006   2007    2008   2009    2010    2011    2012   2013   2014   2015*9,6799,4089,3195,2905,18333422152682541821361357,86915,25515,1370200040006000800010000120001400016000Source: OCHA OPT(*) Data for 2015 only covers January-May (latest available)1 www.gisha.org/graph/2401?datares=monthly2 www.bit.ly/1TEpnTX // Sales were enabled by the GoI during the current Jewish ﬁshmitaﬂ year only (a special period in a seven-year cycle during which land owned by religious Jews in Israel cannot be exploited)3 www.bit.ly/1IVVAA3 // Exports data only includes truckloads leaving Gaza with destination Israel or other international markets (i.e. does not include Gaza-produced goods marketed in the West Bank) The RAND Corporation presented a report aimed at estimating the costs of the Israeli-Palestinian study builds on detailed analysis to calculate the Palestinians and Israelis of ranging from a two-state solution to a situation of violent uprisingRecent analysis by the IMF focuses on Palestine™s recommendations to enhance tax collection and deriving GDP growth with the PNA Ministry of National Economy and launched a new National Export Strategy for 2014-2018ﬁInternational Green Environment & Energy Expo & Forumﬂ took place in Ramallah between 2-4 JuneThe Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

According to PALTRADE, successful implementation of the strategy could increase the value of Palestinian in a 67% overall growth in total exports.Green Energy Forum& Energy Expo & Forumﬂ took place in Ramallah between 2-4 June.11 The private sector-led event brought together numerous local businesses as well as regional and international organisations active in the sector with the intention of showcasing opportunities for investment and development. More than 20 exhibitors raised awareness around the importance of preserving the environment, promoting greater energy independence in Palestine, and rationalizing consumption. Dr. Omar Kitaneh, chairman of the PNA Energy and Natural Resources Authority, addressed the conference, stressing the strategic importance of renewable energy for Palestine™s development and the government™s commitment to enabling investment in the sector. With over 60 companies working on renewable energy, 40 of which are organised under the Palestinian Federation of Renewable Energy Industries, the sector is gaining momentum. Following long-standing blocks to the development of projects due to regulatory gaps, it is expected that the Cabinet approval of a draft Renewable Energy Law in May 2015 will unlock investment and job creation opportunities. 11 www.facebook.com/IGEE.Expo?fref=photo\n",

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 106July 2015National AccountsIn Q1 2015, country-level quarterly GDP decreased by 0.8% in real terms from the previous quarter and from Q1 2014.1 The year-on-year drop was mainly explained by a 8.2% decrease in Gaza´s quarterly GDP, where the very slow pace of post-war reconstruction efforts and the limited lifting of external restrictions on economic activity resulted in sharp drops in the value added by services (-18.7%) and wholesale and retail activities (-16.8%). The West Bank´s GDP increased by almost 2% from Q1 2014, although this was mainly motivated by rises in the net collection of VAT on imports (23%) and custom duties (27%). Enhanced tax collection partly compensated real drops in the value added by important economic activities, including construction (-8%) and manufacturing (-10%). Poor economic performance in the West Bank during Q1 2015 is likely to be related to decreased consumption due to the inability of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to pay public workers´ salaries in full during January and February, after the Government of Israel (GoI) temporarily suspended the transfer of clearance revenues.Most economic sectors contracted at the country level in Q1 2015 with respect to the previous year (Table 1). Relative contribution to GDP fell for nearly all productive sectors.

This, according to PIBF, could boost GDP from $12bn to $44bn in ten years. PIBF™s research estimates that the FTA would enable double-digit growth The research suggests that export-driven growth could be centred on high potential economic sectors, most notably the manufacturing industry, agriculture and tourism (all of which have experienced poor growth under the status quo). Opportunities for these and other sectors are deemed greater in the Pan-Arab market, which is expected to become the main destination for Palestinian exports, alongside Israel.Korean Support for Tech Start-upsIn June the Korea International Cooperation Agency signed agreements with the PNA Ministry of Planning and Administrative Development and the PNA Ministry of Telecommunication and Information Technology to support Palestinian IT start-ups with $7m in grants, to be disbursed under the Palestine Start-Up Support (PASS) programme.11 The PASS aims to activate the start-up ecosystem in both the West Bank and Gaza by improving the investment environment, intensifying an acceleration programme and fostering greater collaboration between universities and the business sector. The Representative National Information Society Agency and the Al-Bireh Municipality also signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the establishment of an IT centre at the Al-Bireh Youth Center.12Korean cooperation in the high-tech sector is part of the country´s broader efforts to intensify its ties with Palestine.

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 58July 2011Energy Pricing and ConsumptionThe Palestinian Electricity Regulatory Council has announced a new system of pricing which will bring price uniformity to the majority of the Palestinian Territory and is expected to substantially reduce the cost of electricity for households and companies.1 Dr Omar Kittaneh, Chairman of the Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority, estimates that citizens and companies will pay 15-37% less for their electricity. The saving will depend on the price that customers were paying previously.the cost of these reforms. This will gradually be withdrawn over four years to incentivise improved performance from the electricity companies, including increasing the rate of payment collection which has historically been low. The price reduction will help bring down the proportion of household income spent on electricity which, at 10%, is one of the highest in the region.2The scheme categorises households based on their monthly consumption: below 100 kWh, 101-200 kWh, and above 200 kWh. Households with a lower monthly consumption, typically poorer households, will pay lower prices per kWh. The price of electricity with regular or prepaid meters will be the same per kWh, but regular meters will require a monthly subscription of NIS 10. The price of electricity for commercial purposes (retail businesses for example) will decline by 2-22%.  Industrial enterprises will pay 22-36% less, the price of electricity used in agriculture will drop by 27-37% and in water pumping by 20-24%.The new system will treat the Jordan River Valley region in a special manner to emphasise the importance of the area in agrarian and industrial development. Households and industries in the valley will pay NIS 0.05-0.20 less per kWh than in other areas, which will mean a price reduction of nearly 40% for the region.The most recent energy survey, released in June by the Palestinian Central Bureau for Statistics (PCBS), shows that nearly all Palestinian households (99.8%) are now connected to the public electricity network.3 Between January 2010 and January 2011, average household consumption of electricity grew by 4.72%, reaching 266 kWh in the current year. While both normal (57.7%) and prepaid (42.3%) meters are widely used within the West Bank, prepaid meters remain unavailable in the Gaza Strip.1 See: http://www.maannews.net/arb/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=398242&MARK=%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%A92 See: July 2010 Bulletin Economic Feature3 See: http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/HouseHoldEN012011E.pdfThe London Stock Exchange hosted the second Palestinian Capital Markets Day in June.

The Palestinian ICT sector has grown by 25-30% over the last decade and now represents 5% of Palestinian GDP.1 According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) the use of computers, the internet and rose from 21% in 2007 to 30% by the end of 2009, internet usage increased from only 13% in 2007 to 20% in 2009 and e-commerce transactions have doubled, from 2% in 2007 to 4% in 2009.2 During the conference a range of topics were discussed. This included how to attract foreign direct investment, the development of science and technology parks, growing ICT clusters, internet infrastructure and connectivity. The main speakers were the Minister of Technology and Information Technology Dr. Mashhour Abu Daka, Governor and Chairman of the Board of the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) Dr. Jihad Al-Wazir, CEO of Palestine IT Association (PITA) Laith Kassis and Chairman of PITA Ala Alaeddin.3 Alongside the main conference a number of other events and workshops were organised. Multinational companies showcased their latest technology and opportunities for partnership during a series of Multinational Technology Days, held in different cities across the West Bank. Companies included some of the biggest names in the global ICT industry, like Microsoft and Cisco. These events were intended to build on the successful $10m partnership between Palestinian companies and Cisco that was signed at last year™s event.  Local companies discussed how to enhance the organisational capacity of the sector at a series of workshops. There was also a forum in which entrepreneurs presented their innovative business ideas and inventions. In Gaza City over 14,000 people visited an exhibition with 17 local companies for those that could not travel to the West Bank for the event.41 See: http://www.expotech.ps/2010/etemplate.php?id=58 2 See: http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/CIT2009_E.pdf3 See: http://www.expotech.ps/2010/pdfs/TechConfAgenda_November2010.pdf 4 See: http://www.maannews.net/arb/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=331367 and http://www.maannews.net/ARB/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=330861 and http://web.alquds.com/node/302220 and http://www.expotech.ps/2010/   Palestinian foreign investment survey were released on 13 October.

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 82July 2013Entrepreneurship in PalestineThe Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) has recently launched the 2012 edition of its Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Country Report for Palestine.1 The GEM initiative, which covers more than 60 countries worldwide, measures country-level entrepreneurial activity rates, conducts cross-country analysis on Following an extensive survey by MAS, the report stresses the role of entrepreneurship as one of the key drivers of the Palestinian economy. In 2012 around 10% of the Palestinian population aged 18-64 had been involved in starting or running a business at some stage during the previous 42 months. Overall, as many as 273,000 entrepreneurs were active in Palestine in 2012. In this same year, entrepreneurship activity rates in other MENA economies such as Egypt and Algeria were of 8.8% and 7.8%, respectively. Despite high entrepreneurial activity rates (and in line with global trends2), a major gender gap exists among entrepreneurs in Palestine. In 2012 the early-stage entrepreneurship rate for males in the West Bank was 16%, four times the 4% ratio registered among women. This represents a widening of the gender gap observed in 2010, when 18% of men and 10% of women were considered to be entrepreneurs. In Gaza, the entrepreneurship gender gap increased from about 5% in 2010 (when the male rate was around 6% and that of females was below 1%) to nearly 14% in 2012 (when the male rate rose to 16% and the female ratio reached 2%).While the middle-aged population (25-44) is typically the most likely to participate in entrepreneurial activities, their engagement has decreased over the last 3 years. At the same time, the participation of the youngest adult population segment (18-24) increased. This trend is regarded by MAS as a very positive development since youth entrepreneurship is considered to be one of the main driving forces of any economy: young entrepreneurs contribute enthusiasm, motivation and innovation. The report also shows that the average Palestinian entrepreneur is well-educated, as there is a high positive correlation between entrepreneurial activity rates and Palestine was prepared), early-stage entrepreneurship has become slightly more equally distributed among individuals with different educational levels. Income levels also appear to be among the main determinants of entrepreneurship. Individuals with higher household income are more likely to start entrepreneurial are motivated by opportunity (58%) rather than by necessity (42%).Finally, the report also shows that entrepreneurship also plays a crucial role in terms of employment generation. As estimated by MAS, in 2012 762,900 jobs were directly related to the development of entrepreneurial activities, accounting for as much as 77% of the Palestinian labour force. More than 273,000 of those employed were entrepreneurs themselves (owners and managers of small companies) and 1 www.mas.ps/2012/Publications2 www.gemconsortium.org/docs/download/2645In Q1 2013 Palestinian real GDP decreased by 5.1% with respect to the previous quarter and was 2.7% higher than in Q1 2012.During July the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry launched the Palestine Business Council for Dubai and Northern Emirates.On 26 June the PA Ministry of National Economy and the Union of Palestinian Chambers of Commerce Chamber Information System.™The Palestinian Monetary Authority Business Cycle Indicator experienced a major drop in June.In June 2013 the overall consumer price index slightly increased with respect to the previous month.The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 92May 2014Labour MarketIn Q1 2014 total unemployment in Palestine reached 26.2%, up from 25.2% in the previous quarter and 2.3 percentage points higher than in Q1 2013.1 The year-on-year change was fully explained by a sharp rise in the unemployment rate in Gaza, which reached almost 41% in Q1 2014 (its highest level since 2008), up from 31% in Q1 2013. The rise in unemployment in Gaza was mostly driven by an absolute loss of around 12,500 jobs in the construction sector, greatly affected by the destruction of trading tunnels with Egypt and the long-standing restrictions on imports of construction materials from Israel. As a result, construction™s share of total employment in Gaza decreased from 6.9% in Q1 2013 to 2.2% in Q1 2014. At the same time, in the West Bank more than 29,000 jobs were added in commerce, hotels and restaurants, and around 20,000 new positions were created in construction activities between Q1 2013 and Q1 2014.Total unemployment in Q1 2014 was higher among women (36.5%) than among male workers (23.3%). The increase in total unemployment was partly explained by a rise in total labour force participation (LFP). As more workers entered the labour market, LFP reached 46.3% in Q1 2014, up from 43.4% in Q1 2013. LFP increased the most among Gazan women on a year-to-year basis (+5.1 percentage points), making female LFP in Gaza (20.5%) higher than in the West Bank (19.8%). However, female LFP continues to be low at an aggregate level, reaching 17.3% (against 69.3% among men). This is a common feature of several countries in the region, as LFP rates among Syrian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Lebanese women are equally low (ranging between 13-24%). Cultural reasons seem to be the main underlying factor keeping women out of the labour market, as almost 70% of Palestinian women who were not looking for a job in 2013 carried out housework. Annual data for 2013 shows that total unemployment, at 23.4%, reached its highest level since 2010. Following a long-term trend, the total unemployment rate was much higher in Gaza (32.6%) than in the West Bank (18.6%).

This is a market we should encourage, since they are mainly coming to our side. What about the quality of tourism services? Do you see a Most hotels have historically been training their own employees. They bring workers from anywhere and simply get them to work. That is already done, but we should not continue on that basis. This is why our current project to create a hospitality school in Jericho is so important, as it will allow us to improve the quality of the offerings and professionalise services. We see that people are willing to stay in Palestine, but they obviously expect a professional service.Can you tell us more about the school project? It is a joint venture between the hotel association and the tour operator association, which I preside. It is purely will include the PA Ministry of Education and Ministry the curricula, for graduates to be acknowledged and have priority when looking for a job. Seed money for the investment came from American donors and we are now hoping that the Japanese will engage as well. Although we expect to raise around 60% of total investment from donor funding, the school will operate as a hotel too, since we need to ensure the commercial sustainability of the project. We should not depend on donations for the rest of our lives, but survive and stand on our own. I am very optimistic about the future of tourism in Palestine, even without peace. Of course that if we had peace it would be the best thing that ever happened to us. But even under the conditions in which we are living now we see a modest (although continuous) increase in the level of activity. Tourism is the only industry that is really viable as far as I am concerned; it is our petroleum, and something we have to protect. I believe that in the mid to long term it could constitute up to 30% of GDP.making a mistake is that they are competing with each other rather than working to improve income per hotel. Whenever tourists are visiting the Holy Land, Israel and Palestine, we need to make programmes in which they stay overnight in Jericho, Bethlehem and East Jerusalem. But it is not the quantity that we are after at the end of the day, but the quality. We are limited in the numbers of visitors we can absorb: how many people can visit the Church of the Nativity? How many people can walk in the Old City of Jerusalem? We have to be careful. It is not a mass production industry. The focus should be on providing a better service and getting a higher income for that. We need to develop ´boutique´ or ´niche´ tourism for the time being. What particular tourist segments are you thinking about for the development of niche tourism?Now our business is basically depending on religious tourists. This has been good, and we should protect it. However, to increase our numbers dramatically, we should go into cultural trips and approach large companies in markets with high potential. Another sector that could be important for us is the Diaspora. And to attract them we have to create events. We are happy to see that the Ramallah Club from North America will be having their annual meeting in Ramallah this summer. Another particularly promising market for Diaspora tourists is in South America, where there are many Palestinians from Bethlehem, Beit Sahour and Beit Jala. pilgrimage destinations, such as Lourdes in France or Fatima in Portugal? It is! And that is really a shame! I think that the detrimental part is related to the political issue. And we are talking about just one segment here, the Christians, but how about the Muslims coming to Palestine? If tourists from the Arab world were allowed to come into Israel they would swamp the place. It is the third holiest site for Islam. Muslim pilgrimage is not complete without coming to Jerusalem. Of course for political reasons Israel is not opening the door for this market. However, there are \n",

According to Ms. Ongley, ﬁAny lasting and meaningful improvement in prospects for the Palestinian economy ultimately depends on commitment to the peace process and a political breakthroughﬂ. If accompanied by reduced restrictions and enhanced control over resources, such a breakthrough, would allow for rapid private sector-led growth.Ms. Ongley praised the efforts by the Ministry of Finance months of 2017 exceeded expectations. As a result of the strong revenue mobilisation and spending restraint, the IMF end of 2017, 1.7% lower than previously projected. However, Ongley added that support from the international community further weakening growth prospects. She also called support observed in recent years.22 http://bit.ly/2vrFFMKWhile the IMF continues to support the efforts by the PNA to boost domestic revenues through improved tax administration, Ms. Ongley advised against granting new tax exemptions and instead suggested considering new measures that could yield additional revenue and contribute to a more progressive tax regime. Ms. Ongley, stressed that efforts to reduce expenditure should focus on containing the overall wage bill, increasing the recovery for electricity and water consumption.Launch of a $25m Fund to Support JerusalemitesOn 21 July, the Palestinian President announced the establishment of a $25m fund aimed at supporting the Palestinian population of Jerusalem, through programs focusing on citizens, merchants and institutions.23  The announcement came as a response to the latest political developments surrounding the Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem.

This was a result of decreased foreign assistance, the uncertainty caused by the Israeli restrictions and the global economic crisis.1 The West Bank economy grew at 7.1% in 2009, 6.8% in 2010 and 5.8% in 2011.2 In contrast there was high GDP growth of 26.6% in 2011 for Gaza, partly due to easing of Israeli restrictions, aid term growth.$1.5bn in budget support and development expenditure in 2011. By the end of the but gross domestic revenues were nearly 12% lower than budgeted. Furthermore, the PA only received about $814m in budget support and $169m of development borrowing from the local banking sector, increasing net domestic bank borrowing by $140m (raising the stock of government debt to the banking system to a total of $1.1bn or 11% of GDP), and accumulating arrears of $0.5bn to the private sector and the public pension fund.3 In the reports both the World Bank and the IMF achievements of recent years and continue the provision of basic services.The IMF report notes that the Palestinian banking system continued performing infrastructure.

We have prevented from selling in East Jerusalem. That™s motivated us to expand production outside the Palestinian Territory.  Import restrictions make things hard too.

The Palestinian tourism sector also suffers from being unable to develop sites of interest including the Dead Sea and the Jordan Valley region.  The lack of access to agricultural and water resources in Area C is another major impediment. The World Bank demonstrates the potential value of the Jordan Valley to the Palestinian economy by noting that Israeli agricultural production in the Jordan Valley generates about NIS 500 million annually.

Both reports focus on the slowdown in economic activity, observed during 2012. Real GDP growth reached 5.9% last year, down from an average rate of almost 11% in 2010-2011.3 The World Bank attributes the slowdown to the absence of easing In particular, the organisation stresses that the continuation of restrictions and the absence of real opportunities to open up the Palestinian economy are major obstacles to allow private sector-led growth.High and persistent unemployment (especially among youth) continues to pose a major challenge to the Palestinian Economy, characterised by low labour force participation rates, high unemployment duration and the concentration of workers Bank these factors prevent many Palestinians of working age from developing on-the-job skills, which are much needed to enhance local competitiveness in the global economy.As a result of the current situation, the IMF™s growth forecasts (shown in table 1 below) have deteriorated with respect to their September 2012 assessment. The baseline assumes a continued deadlocked peace process, falling donor aid as a per cent of GDP and no progress in phasing out the Israeli restrictions on lower donor support and even slower progress on structural reforms than in the baseline scenario.Figure 1: IMF Real GDP Growth Forecasts (%)20132014201520162013201420152016Baseline ScenarioDownside ScenarioSeptember 20125.65.24.8n/a3.02.01.0n/aMarch 20135.04.43.63.1-0.63.73.12.7Source: IMF staff projectionsThe World Bank report also pays close attention to the impact of the PA™s competitiveness of the Palestinian economy.

On 19 November, over 200 people attended the ‚Towards a Green Future™ conference which was sponsored by the Italian Government, the PA and UN agencies. Attendees acknowledged green energy and the environment as critical factors for Palestinian economic growth and development. A ‚Joint Declaration™ between Italy and the PA was formalised at the conference and a ‚Technical Steering Committee™ was established to enhance cooperation and development of eco-sustainable activities and projects.1While this is a relatively new area of focus for the Palestinian economy there are a few green projects already underway. In Hebron, a wind turbine will supply 700kw of energy to the Al-Ahli Hospital, covering approximately 40% of its total requirements. Energy costs of the hospital, which is the largest in the West Bank, will be reduced by 30-40% as a result. The EU has contributed •1.3m towards the three-year project, which was launched at the end of September 2009.2Rawabi, the planned new city outside Ramallah, has been designed to be green spaces throughout the commercial and residential areas and special attention has been given to the transport system to reduce the use of cars. Water re-use, waste water treatment, energy preservation techniques, rain harvesting and recycling strategies have all been taken into consideration during the design phase. A tree-planting initiative, ﬁGROW for a Greener Palestineﬂ, has commenced on the site. 25,000 new trees will be planted and a further 5,000 relocated during construction. Individuals are able to purchase trees through the Rawabi website.3It is expected that there will be an increase in the number of green initiatives in the Palestinian Territory next year. With 3,000 sunshine hours per year there is high potential from solar power. Many Palestinians already take a sustainable approach to energy Œ 68% of households use solar water heating systems.4 Abdullah Shra™rawi, Business Development Manager at PADICO, stressed the economic viability of green energy, stating that PADICO considers investment in this sector as ‚low risk with long term capital growth™ and plans to expand its investment into the green energy sector in the next 3 years. Ilaria Debonis, from the Consulate General of Italy, told the Bulletin that the Italian government are currently considering a new project related to ‚green schools™ with the assistance of Italian architects.1 See: http://www.agriregionieuropa.univpm.it/materiale/2009/Final_Agenda.pdf 2 See: http://www.awep.ps/3 See: http://www.rawabi.ps/plant.php 4 See: http://www.agriregionieuropa.univpm.it/materiale/2009/Final_Concept_paper.pdf A new Code of Corporate Governance has been launched by the Palestinian Capital Markets Authority (PCMA) and the National Committee for Corporate Governance.

The crossing point, which actually opened to cars on 13 October, had previously only been accessible on foot or by large goods vehicles.

This includes the provision of food and water, as well as cash handouts. Some donors have already responded and $2.5m has been committed by the United Arab Emirates, $1m by India and •1m by Italy. Mauritania, Egypt and Qatar have also each donated $20,000, $25,000 and $50,000 respectively. Based on the immediate response, and last year™s overall commitments from donors, UNRWA expect to secure enough funding to see their emergency service provision maintained at current levels throughout 2010.1Alongside the emergency fund, UNRWA™s General Fund provides core education, healthcare and social services. According to Gunness the working capital of the General Fund dropped to -$7.4m at the beginning of December 2009. Whilst the budget was balanced by the end of December, the General Fund starts 2010 increase their funding this year.In December the European Union pledged •10m to UNRWA™s education programmes and the UK donated £5m for the salaries of teachers working in UNRWA schools. Despite these pledges, Gunness said that the capacity of the General Fund to meet its current commitments, costing approximately $34m per month, is still being determined on a month by month basis.  This includes the salaries of UNRWA™s 30,000 employees. To remedy the situation, cuts to services are under consideration, including a reduction in key medical treatments. UNRWA Director of Operations in Gaza, John Ging, told the Bulletin that cuts to services in Gaza would have a devastating impact. ‚The most basic medical services are already on the brink of collapse, while the impoverished education system is completely overwhelmed by the 450,000 children in Gaza. A lack of education spells doom for an entire generation, and dampens prospects for recovery and future development in Gaza™ he said.  There could also be a wider economic impact if UNRWA jobs have to be cut or salary payments are delayed.there has been an increase in the number of individuals dependent upon UNRWA assistance. Second, there has been a decline in the contributions of major donors. Arab states, for example, previously pledged to provide 8% of the organization™s operating budget, yet only contributed the equivalent of 1 See: http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=244191 and http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=22270 and http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=241748 and http://www.itcoop-jer.org/newsletter_ing/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1257244851&archive=&start_from=&ucat=4& and http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=22270 The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reports that GDP is largely unchanged, decreasing by less than 1% in Q3 2009 compared to Q2 2009.

While entrepreneurship is distributed among a variety of sectors, the services sector is dominant.  The report investigated the motivation of those starting businesses and found that across the Palestinian Territory for every 41 entrepreneurs motivated by necessity, 100 were motivated by economic opportunity. The rate of necessity-driven entrepreneurship is higher in Gaza due to the scarcity of business opportunities there.Financing remained a major issue for Palestinian entrepreneurs; the median start-up capital for a new business was $2,095, which is high compared government programmes and informal investors. The report concluded that the increase in bank deposits in the Palestinian Territory has not been accompanied by a similar rise in credit facilities.  The loan to deposit ratio for Q1 2011 was 47.3%.31changes.  Initiated in 1999 with 10 countries, GEM 2010 includes 59 economies at different stages of development from around the globe.

However, the growth in Gaza comes from a very low base, with the comparison made to the period of Operation Cast Lead. Living standards in Gaza are still said to be 60% below those in 1994.3There are concerns that the current level of growth is not sustainable given the high proportion of economic activity generated by services and the public sector (almost 40% of total activity).

Palestine has a very open economy, unlike many countries in the region. We welcome and protect foreign investors. I am very proud of this openness. Despite the challenges, we need to use each and every opportunity to market Palestinian products abroad, to reach new international markets and to give export oriented companies the opportunity to grow. participate in the global EXPO, taking place in Milan. What sector offers the greatest opportunities moving forward?One sector that I believe is particularly important for the Palestinian economy is industry, unfortunately, trade has become dependent on the Israeli market, 97% of imports and 89% of exports are made to/from or through Israel. Tourism is also important for the Palestinian economy. great potential, especially if the political situation is stable.The labour market continues to be characterised by very high unemployment. What should the priorities be for job creation?In order to create employment, sustainable projects are needed. The Palestinian economy is heavily dependent on donors, which come with limited-time projects. Such projects, especially in infrastructure, offer direct, immediate jobs but are not sustainable. Moving forward, additional job creation will need to come from the private sector.  How do you see the role of the private sector and what can the government do to support businesses™ efforts?The Ministry will work closely with the private sector. meetings with representatives of the private sector. I will remain very open and continue to promote  dialogue. In terms of policy, we will focus on creating an adequate enabling environment for expanding businesses. During my time at the PCMA, I noticed that although listed grow. These are public companies, which means that they are looking for investors, but they cannot rely on Palestinian money alone. Thus, foreign investments are of crucial importance. To boost foreign investment we need to work on key economic laws. My short-term priority will that in 2015 companies in the West Bank operate under Jordanian law from 1964, while business in Gaza work under Egyptian law, dated back to 1929. These laws need to be brought up to date and united to govern companies within the Palestinian State.July TradingIn July the Al-Quds index increased by 0.8% from June, reaching 482.4 points on the last day of trading.6 A total of 8.5m shares worth $26.8m were traded during the month.

      "The Portland TrustTHE 100th ISSUE OF THE BULLETINThe Portland Trust celebrates the 100th issue of the Palestinian Economic Bulletinedition of the ‚Palestinian Economic Bulletin™ in October 2006. In the intervening years we have sought to provide accurate insights into the Palestinian economy to our local and global readership. This month I am proud to introduce our 100th issue. I would like to express gratitude to all those who have contributed to the Bulletin over the years. In particular, I would like to thank our partners at MAS for their work and support each month. Without them the Bulletin would not be possible. At the same time, it would be remiss not to acknowledge our readers, not just for reading the Bulletin each month but also for their constructive feedback.As I write, we are at a time of political uncertainty and economic slowdown following the collapse of the peace negotiations in April 2014 and the war in Gaza last summer. Preliminary estimates indicate that the Palestinian economy improvement previously. GDP per capita has only increased marginally over the last two decades and is estimated to have fallen by 5.5% in 2014. In Gaza, GDP per capita has declined by 33% since 1994. Total unemployment is estimated at 27%, with unemployment rates of youth aged 20-24 in the West Bank and Gaza of 27.5% and 68.3%, respectively.The Portland Trust continues to believe that a vibrant private sector-led economy is crucial for sustainable growth and job creation, as well as for peace in the region to take hold. During 2014 we have, therefore, sustained our efforts to support the development of Palestinian businesses through the implementation of ‚Beyond Aid™, an economic initiative by the Palestinian private sector which envisages the creation of almost 400,000 jobs by 2030.1However, it must be acknowledged that any private sector development efforts will be seriously constrained without an improvement to the enabling environment and, in particular, political progress leading to the creation of a thriving Palestinian state. It is therefore absolutely crucial that all concerned parties work together towards achieving a peace efforts.  We hope that the Palestinian Economic Bulletin will continue to inform the public debate and inspire business, policy makers and international organisations to direct their efforts towards the creation of a sustainable economy.  Sir Ronald CohenChairman, The Portland Trust 1 www.portlandtrust.org/publications/beyond-aid-palestinian-private-sector-initiative-investment-growth-and-employmentDr. Nabeel Kassis, MAS Director GeneralMAS perceives its partnership with The Portland Trust as one of high value that enables us to reach out to a Palestinian economy. For MAS, the Palestinian Economic Bulletin is a vital instrument for dispersing knowledge about the Palestinian economy domestically, regionally, and internationally. The constantly growing readership is a testimony of the success of this endeavour. Through its nearly decade-long history (since 2006) and its 100 issues, the Bulletin has recorded moments of impressive growth as well as disappointing stagnation and even declines in the economy. Last year was a challenging one for all, especially the second half following the devastating effects of the war in the summer in Gaza. We start 2015 with the hope that there will be more positive news for the Bulletin to write about in the comming months.Bulletin 100 Œ January 2015\n",

Nominal GDP per capita reached $3,186 in 2013, registering stark differences between the West Bank ($4,200) and Gaza ($1,715).1 Overall real GDP growth slowed in Q4 2013, reaching only 0.3% with respect to the previous quarter (as a result of a 1.2% increase in the West Bank and a 2.3% drop in Gaza). Annual growth between 2012 and 2013 is estimated at just over 2%.2between 2006 and 2011 (reaching 12% in 2011) before falling to 5.9% in 2012. It is broadly recognised that much of the growth over these years was largely fueled by donor support. As international aid declined in the years running up to 2012 the Palestinian economy consequently slowed. Sustainable recovery sector-led growth. Comparing the contributions of key economic sectors over time it appears that there has been an underlying structural shift in the Palestinian economy. Agriculture now only constitutes 3.7% of GDP, down from 7.1% in 2004 and 13.3% in 1994. Conversely the retail sector is now a larger part of the economy, increasing from 9.8% in 2004 to 17.8% in 2013. The construction sector contributed over 11% to Palestinian GDP in 2013. This is on a par with its contribution in 1994, but growth engine in Gaza during 2011 and 2012, contributing more than 20% to GDP.

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 97October 2014Gaza Reconstruction On 12 October, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the governments of Egypt and Norway hosted an international donor conference in Cairo to discuss the challenges facing Gaza™s reconstruction.1 The total cost of relief, recovery and reconstruction following the 51-day Israeli military operation launched in Gaza on 8 July is estimated at $4bn (an amount equivalent to around 35% of Palestinian GDP and about three times the estimated cost after the 2008 war). The conference, attended by representatives of EU and Arab League countries, the World Bank, the IMF, various UN agencies and different Arab and Islamic organisations, secured a total of $5.4bn in pledges from international donors. Around half of this sum is expected to be directly allocated to Gaza, with the rest going to support other funding needs of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).2 Funding for much needed early recovery and reconstruction works is expected to include major contributions from Qatar ($1bn), the EU ($568m), the US ($212m), the UAE ($200m) and Turkey ($200m).3 Discussions during the conference also focused on the need to strengthen the Palestinian government™s ability to assume its responsibilities in the rehabilitation of Gaza, as well as the necessary mechanisms to enable the import and export of goods and materials to and from Gaza (by building on existing efforts by the UN). Prior to the conference, the Palestinian government™s Higher Inter-Ministerial Committee for Gaza Recovery and Reconstruction presented an impact assessment of the latest operation and a comprehensive strategy for the implementation of recovery measures.4 The governmental plan, developed with assistance from a broad range of stakeholders (including Palestinian line ministries, the local private sector and different international organisations), is aimed at transitioning from urgent relief efforts to longer-term development needs, across four areas: social protection, infrastructure, economic development and governance and institution building. While short-term efforts will focus on ensuring rapid improvements to the lives of the thousands of affected citizens, the government™s long-term vision for Gaza The PNA plan is structured around three phases (Table 1): an urgent relief phase including rapid and short-term interventions ($414m); an early recovery phase involving interventions of up to 12 months ($1.2bn); and a reconstruction and development phase, expected to be implemented over the longer term ($2.4bn). The social sector chapter of the plan is aimed at combatting poverty, vulnerability and food insecurity in Gaza, which increased sharply as a result of extensive 1 www.mfa.gov.eg/gazaconference/default_en.html2 www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29586636 3 already pledged, bringing the total U.S. contribution to $414 million.

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 109October 2015National Accounts In Q2 2015, country-level GDP increased by 6% in real terms compared to the previous quarter, and was 2.1% higher than in Q2 2014.1 The 2.1% year-to-year appreciation in GDP was mainly due to growth in construction activities (22%) and customs duties (24.1%). The overall quarter-to-quarter rise in GDP was due in part to a 31.1% increase in construction activities. Services activities remained the largest contributor to GDP (21%) and employment (35.7%) in Q2 2015.2Real quarterly GDP in the West Bank ($1,501.3m) increased by 5.1% in Q2 compared to the previous quarter and 3.3% from Q2 2014. The year-on-year increase was mostly explained by high growth in customs duties (24.3%).  In Gaza, real GDP increased by 8.9% compared to the previous quarter, while it decreased by 1.5% compared to Q2 2014 - signalling that the recovery to the pre-war economic output level in Gaza is still underway. The quarterly increase was due primarily to growth in construction activities (78.7%). Country-level GDP per capita was $448.2 in Q2 2015, a decrease of 0.9% from Q2 2014. In the West Bank, GDP per capita was $478.8 in Q2 2015, up 0.6% compared to Q2 2014.

As part of this, of the census. The use of GIS devices in the production of the census will allow for more reliable data at the lowest possible geographical level to be collected in a time in the development of the National Statistical System.Another priority is collecting data on Palestinians in Diaspora, where we have already implemented two surveys in coordination with the UN and other relevant governmental agencies within Lebanon. We are currently in the preparation phase to conduct a Population Census for the Palestinian Refugees in Refugee Camps and Localities nearby the camps in Lebanon.What are your strategies for adapting to such volatile environment?PCBS keeps on working uninterruptedly under the most challenging circumstances, even during the Gaza war last is answering their needs of data covering all aspects of life, we have adopted several strategies such as: enforcing the focusing on the capacity building of our staff, as they are the resource that we depend on to keep functioning and be able to secure reliable data in a timely manner.  PCBS is characterized by its innovative and open approach and agenda. What are some of the top innovations you™re seeing in the collection and use of statistics? PCBS focuses on strengthening statistical knowledge and raising awareness of statistics. As part of this work, PCBS is ensuring that the school curricula contains statistics We use a variety of media such as cartoons, animation, and infographics to create and enhance awareness among our students. Furthermore, through adopting social media such as the PCBS Website, Facebook, and Twitter, we ensure that data is disseminated in a wider range of people.

What are your goals as the head of such prestigious organization, and what does it mean for Palestine and the region?To begin with, on the personal level I am very happy with this accomplishment as I was not seeking for this post but rather nominated to it by other member countries. I believe this will help put Palestine on the global map and is recognition of the high professionalism of our organization.  My goal as the President of IAOS is to strengthen the organization through better engagement with its members. My strategy for achieving this includes four that the work of IAOS is relevant to its members and to other peer organizations. Second, maintain visibility at statistical events to maintain an appropriate role in global statistical directions. Third, build new partnerships and develop existing ones so IAOS can better serve the global statistical community.

It will assist in shedding light on how data is being produced under challenging circumstances, which are no longer limited to Palestine but are being faced by various countries within the region such as Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Yemen, and Libya. Such data is of high importance since it can help show what is happening on the ground and what interventions should be mobilized.I aim to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries in several international priorities such as moving from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Finally, one of our goals will be to draw attention to the challenges faced I believe if we are able to succeed in this, we will leave a well needed imprint on the global agenda.\n",

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 103April 2015National AccountsThe Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) released preliminary national accounts estimates for Q4 2014.1 National GDP increased by 6.8% in real terms from the previous quarter to $1,878.6m, but fell 1.1% year on year. This expansion followed a sharp contraction of 9.1% in Q3 2014 following the war in Gaza. Real GDP in the West Bank ($1,470.9m) increased by 4% from Q3 2014 and by 4.9% from Q4 2013. In Gaza, which had seen real GDP fall by 28.4% in Q3 2014, GDP rose by 18.5% in the last quarter of 2014 to $407.7m, indicating a partial recovery from the economic damage caused by the war in the summer. Public administration and defence continued to make up a very high proportion of GDP in Gaza, at 35.6%, compared to just 7% in the West Bank. Much of the growth in Gaza was driven by improvements in construction and wholesale & retail trade (up by 64%, although again still substantially lower than the levels achieved throughout 2013 and up to Q2 2014). However, compared to the corresponding quarter in 2013, real GDP in Gaza was down 18.3%, highlighting that Gaza has a long way to go to even achieve parity with the already depressed economic conditions of 2013. For 2014 as a whole, national real GDP is estimated to have decreased by 0.4% overall, which when disaggregated translates into a 5.1% rise in the West Bank and a substantial 15.2% fall in Gaza.

Deceleration was greatest in agriculture, where value added dropped by almost 10% on a year-to-year basis. As a result, agricultural activities accounted for 3.6% of total value added in the West Bank in Q3 2013, down from 4.1% in Q3 2012.Gazan GDP also registered a low overall year-to-year growth of 2.8% in Q3 2013, mostly as a result of a 19% drop in the value added by construction activities. In Q1 2013, construction represented 27.1% of GDP in the Gaza Strip and accounted for 80% of the observed 12% year-to-year growth. Following the slowdown in Q3 2013, construction™s contribution to GDP dropped to less than 21%The disappointing growth performance in Q3 2013, with rates below the long-term population growth rate, resulted in a year-to-year absolute decrease in GDP per capita. Palestinian real GDP per head in Q3 2013, at $419, was 0.4% lower than in Q3 2012. The annual drop was more pronounced in the Gaza Strip (-0.7%), where GDP per capita reached $272, than in the West Bank (-0.2%; $520).

Palestine will remain on the S&P Dow Jones Indices watch-list for potential future inclusion in the aforementioned indices. Such development typically depends on turnover, number of listings and attraction of foreign investors.11 It is expected that the new inclusion will increase PEX™s exposure and liquidity and attract more international investment.

The trade dispute reached its height on 9 February, when the GoI imposed a ban on all Palestinian agricultural exports, both through Israeli ports and via Jordan, the West Bank™s only direct export route to the outside world.2 According to the Palestinian Export Council, which mobilized in early February to coordinate the Palestinian response to these measures, preventing Palestinians from exporting agricultural products to the rest of the world is considered a breach of the Paris Protocol and World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements.The ban occurred at the peak of the agricultural export season and two months prior to Ramadan, when demand for agricultural produce is at its peak. These developments put further strain on the Palestinian agricultural sector, which faces limited access to land, water, and international markets. Further economic threats face the sector if the GoI proceeds with the annexation of the Jordan Valley,3  which accounts for 60% of vegetables produced in the West Bank and almost 100% of the date harvest in Palestine. On 5 February, a few days prior to the announcement of the total ban, the PNA announced its intention to limit the entry of Israeli products into the Palestinian market, focusing on vegetables, fruits, juices, mineral water, and carbonated drinks.4 It™s decision was in response to an earlier development, on 31 January, when the Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett directed the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to halt the imports of all Palestinian agricultural products into Israel. Palestine exports around $132m of agricultural goods annually, of which 68% ($88m) are exported to Israel.5 Palestinian exports to Israel include tomatoes, potatoes, beans, cucumbers, peppers, onions, and zucchini.6 a solution to the cattle issue. In response, the PNA asserted that the GoI had not abided by the agreement reached in December 2019, whereby the GoI would allow direct import of 10,000 calves from abroad, setting up a special cattle quarantine station and entry of Palestinian eggs to Israeli markets. Trade tensions have been on the rise since September 2019, when the PNA announced its decision to cease calf imports from Israel.7 According to the PNA, this move was a part of a broader strategy to diversify sources of imports and decrease reliance on the Israeli economy.8 123 https://bit.ly/2V8cN7G; https://bit.ly/3bUdjfJ; and see B157 https://bit.ly/2VjsJEq 4 http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=x43r4va115027915827ax43r4v5 https://bit.ly/2vnjGr0; https://bit.ly/2SiSUZK67 See B158 for further details: https://bit.ly/2vaJU07  8 www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/275400\n",

Other factors further constrain productivity. A recent study by the Palestinian National Center for Agricultural Research shows that the level of scrap (waste) in Palestinian olive presses is far from optimal. Monitoring of almost 300 presses over three months showed that more than 70% of all presses operate with over 10% wasted oil in peat, above the 5-8% international average. Only 8 presses in Palestine registered less than 5% waste in peat, indicating a large scope productivity.

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 71August 2012Growing the Private SectorOn 19 July the World Bank launched a new report titled ‚Towards Economic Sustainability of a Future Palestinian State: Promoting Private Sector-Led Growth™ at the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS). The report presents a concrete steps which can be taken now to help support private sector led growth.1The report notes that the main constraints to private sector development are the restrictions imposed by the Government of Israel (GoI), but argues that it is very important for the Palestinian Authority (PA) to take steps to improve the business environment, both to help prepare the ground for a future possible state and to encourage increased investment now. The World Bank suggests several priorities to help improve the business environment: accelerating the process of land registration; continuing to develop beyond the banking sector; establishing an independent telecommunications regulator and making more progress in the legal environment, including passing the competition law.  A substantial section of the report is devoted to steps that can be taken to improve problem, the World Bank points out that high unemployment rates can also be caused by skill mismatches where workers are not equipped for the demands of skills as well as the low level of competencies and experience of graduates to be among the most important constraints to employment of youth in the West Bank and Gaza.™ The World Bank suggests that although the PA has ensured high levels of school attendance and literacy, it needs to do more to support innovative programmes with an emphasis on critical thinking, problem-solving and hands-on learning experiences. In line with this, the World Bank recommends strengthening ties between the technical and vocational education and training institutions and the private sector. In addition, the PA needs to facilitate the transition from education to work by providing graduates with job matching services.Regarding early childhood development, the Bank highlights some of the PA™s successes: for instance the West Bank and Gaza is an outstanding performer in terms of indicators for early childhood nutrition. Equally, school enrollment has always been high, and access to primary education is near universal. However despite this, the quality of education and basic learning outcomes need to be improved.In terms of foreign trade, the World Bank underlines that the Palestinian economy needs to focus on trade in intermediate goods and on exports of high value products. a better business environment (to attract investment), improved trade facilitation (to reduce costs) and a highly skilled labour force with high levels of productivity.1 siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/GrowthStudyEng.pdfThe Palestinian Authority and Government of Israel have agreed on new arrangements regarding the transfer of goods between Israel and the Palestinian Territory and related tax procedures. A new Palestinian TV channel has been launched called Al-sector funded TV channel in the Palestinian Territory. The Israeli Cabinet has increased the number of permits granted to Palestinian construction workers by 5,000. 22.4% of West Bank enterprises reported an improvement in their overall performance between Q1 and Q2 2012.The Bulletin interviews Said Abuhijleh, CEO of Wassel Group, a publically traded Palestinian holding company with 6 subsidiaries specialising in distribution and logistics, security, leasing, cleaning, technology and event management.The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

Under its baseline scenario, which assumes no major changes in the economic and political situation, the PCBS forecast 3.8% growth in real GDP in 2016 resulting in 0.9% growth in real GDP per capita. The number of employees is forecast to rise by 7.7% bringing unemployment down to 25%. Government revenues are forecast to increase by 4.6% due to improvements in tax collection while Government expenses would fall by 1.7%, resulting in a 3.5% by 1.9%. This is due to an expected rise in the value of Palestinian imports by 3.9% and an increase in value of Palestinian exports by 7.4%.The PMA acknowledges that economic forecasts are sensitive to changes in economic and political stability, especially in the Palestinian context characterised by a high-risk environment. If the present economic and political conditions continue, the PMA forecasts a 3.3% growth in real GDP in 2016. Growth would be driven by an increase in private consumption fuelled by a rise in indebtedness and banking loans. The contribution of private consumption to real GDP is expected to rise to 79.9%, while the public sector contribution would decline to 21%.  Exports and imports are forecast to increase by 6.6% and 8.3%, rate climbs to 2%.These baseline projections for 2016 are similar to those presented by the IMF in September 20153. In the Report to the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, the IMF forecast real GDP growth of 3.9% in 2016. Unemployment was forecast to rise to 28% and The Annual Reports analyse the potential risks, both positive and negative, that are likely to impact key economic indicators and set out a number of scenarios. The PCBS ﬁoptimisticﬂ scenario, which is based on an improved political and economic situation, forecasts the economy to expand by 7% leading to a 4% increase in real GDP per capita. The unemployment rate would decline to 23.1% after an 11.6% increase in the number of employees. Government revenues and expenditure would rise by 13.4% and 9.8% respectively. As expenditure is greater The PMA forecasts that economic growth might reach 7.1% in 2016 should positive economic and political shocks occur, including an improvement in the political and security conditions, acceleration in the reconstruction of Gaza and the implementation of major projects.1 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_Forecasting2016E.pdf2 http://bit.ly/20s6fuK and http://bit.ly/1QrBukY3 www.imf.org/external/country/WBG/RR/2015/092115.pdfPresident Mahmoud Abbas approved the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) budget for 2016 in January.

The trade challenges are on the supply side. Exports include olive oil, stone and marble and furniture and constitute 7% of GDP, when the average for lower middle-income countries is 17%.The main developmental problems are trade policy having been conditioned by the Paris Protocol and national developmental plans never prioritising trade policy. The latter is changing as the new national strategy gives more attention to trade policy. With regards to industrial policies, all efforts have been focused on improving the business only 81 manufacturing companies employing more than 50 workers. Most of the economy is comprised of family-run micro and small enterprises with a high proportion of family workers. Who are Palestine™s key strategic trade partners and what is the way forward to enhance trade with them?Palestine is exporting around $10m to Europe per year, $5m to the US and practically nothing to Canada although we have free market access. The most utilised agreement is the Greater Arab Free Trade Agreement (GAFTA). The problem is that there is no supply-side capacity. Palestine does not have the products which the world market is demanding. You cannot export what you produce; you should export what the world wants. Even in GAFTA, 67% of the increase in exports is due to olive oil, stone and marble. The way forward is to look at what the world wants and what of that Palestine can produce and then implement industrial policies to develop those sectors.What is the optimal trade regime under the current circumstances?Soon our project will present a proposal of trade policy for Palestine, including a tariff component. In a study that will be published by MAS soon, we are analysing what would be the most appropriate tariff policy. What is clear is that the Paris Protocol arrangements are completely dysfunctional for the Palestinian economy. The tariff schedule adequate for Israel is not adequate for Palestine, which needs to use tariffs as an instrument of industrial policy Œ to lower the cost of some inputs and protect sectors that have potential. It is the typical ﬁinfant industryﬂ argument. New companies need time to become competitive. WTO? What are the next steps towards its realisation?Palestine is de facto implementing all WTO obligations, because of the Paris Protocol and because Israel is a is the availability of the dispute settlement mechanism, a forum where small countries can defend their interests. Another one is that the WTO agreements are international best practices in many areas, such as technical standards and trade facilitation for the private sector, so being a member would allow Palestine to put its house in order.before starting accession negotiations, which last up to ten years. Palestine requested an observer status in 2009, but no action was taken. Now the Government is exploring the possibility of presenting another request. The project has supported the MoNE in that endeavor, and it is now a political decision.\n",

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4Bulletin Special Feature  January 2017PAYING FOR SUCCESS: SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT IMPACT BONDSINTRODUCTIONPalestine needs new ways of tackling some persistent and costly social problems such as high levels of unemployment, large numbers of young people that are neither in education or employment, and high rates of preventable deaths from chronic diseases such as diabetes. Government, the private sector and civil society organisations are under increasing pressure to help tackle these problems, in a context of declining levels of aid. Social impact investment is one tool that governments all over the world are using to solve enduring social and economic problems youth unemployment (UK) and supporting small scale farmers (Peru).Impact investments can have greatest impact when funding is linked to outcomes. Traditionally, commissioners prescribe and pay for a particular service that they believe will lead to a desired social outcome, known as a ‚fee for service™ contract. However, commissioners are moving towards funding approaches that pay on the basis of outcomes (e.g. reduced unemployment) rather than activities (session In a DIB, investors are repaid by non-government parties such as aid agencies and philanthropists. DIBs, therefore, are part of an effort to apply and adapt SIBs to international development. For this reason, use of outcomes contracts in Palestine may initially be driven by DIBs.This note looks at how impact bonds have been used around the world and sets out how DIBs could best be applied in Palestine. It is organised as follows:In theory - what are impact bonds and why are they useful?In practice Œ when are they useful and at what scale?Next steps - actions to accelerate the use of DIBs in Palestine.Outcomes ContractAny contract between a government and a service provider that involves some element of payment for outcomes achieved, also known as Payment by Results (PbR).CommissionerAny government, donor or foundation with responsibility for buying service provision (typically from an external provider).Social Impact Bond (SIB)Any arrangement made by a service provider to access off-InvestorThe role of the investor in a SIB or DIB contract is to provide funds upfront for services, to be repaid if outcomes are achieved.Development Impact Bond (DIB)The DIB is conceptually the same as a SIB, but non-government parties (such as aid agencies and philanthropists) pay for the outcomes delivered instead of the government.Outcomes FunderThe role of the outcomes funder in a SIB or DIB contract is to have been achieved.use in Palestine remains embryonic. Four priority actions could accelerate the use of DIBs in Palestine:1.Provide support for capacity building for service providers.Services providers, especially early adopters, may requireadditional resources to perform under an outcomes contract,compared to contracting on a pure fee for service basis. Forexample, service providers have to be able to demonstratetheir impact and that they can take on additional funds andscale up their activities. They also have to possess requisitebusiness planning competences to reassure investors thatmoney will be spent judiciously. Grants and business supportcould be made available on a rolling basis to help supportinvestment and bid for outcomes contracts.In the U.S., the Social Innovation Fund Pay for SuccessInitiative awarded over $20m to support feasibility andtechnical assistance for SIBs. More than 50 service providersare currently using federal funds to explore feasibility orsupport project development.  Grants have increasinglyfocused on building the enabling infrastructure for suchprojects, especially cross-system data sharing.  To date, 15SIB transactions have closed in the U.S.2.Support coordination and collaboration between donors.Donors can play the role of either investor or market builderor both. The Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) of the Inter-American Development Bank has allocated $5.3m to exploreSIBs across Latin America. The programme offers support forthe design of and investment in SIBs, including by creatinglocal capabilities amongst governments and other parties.with the goal of lifting poor, female-head households out ofpoverty. The State of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and the Municipalityof Buenos Aires (Argentina) are also receiving MIF™s supportfor the development of SIBs.The fragmentation of public spending across differentgovernment departments and authorities can makeUK Government establishing its Social Outcomes FinanceFund, which acts as an additional central funding streamand encourages different departments to contribute to SIBprojects. In Palestine, this could be addressed by donorscollectively creating a fund to contribute to outcome payments for DIBs.To date, the UK has allocated nearly £200m for outcomes funds. In the U.S., the Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for ResultsAct would establish a $300 million outcomes fund, housedapproved by the House of Representatives.  It is expected topass the House again in early 2017, with supporters hopeful for Senate passage.3.Improve metrics.  Outcomes measurement and evaluation arekey issues for SIBs and DIBs and may require additional skills to those required to contract on a fee for service basis. Building an evidence base of costs would help commissioners assess howmuch they would be willing to pay for outcomes. In 2013, theUK Government published a Unit Cost Database, a free onlineresource to facilitate SIB development which provides detailed National Advisory Board on Impact Investing provided apractical guide to understanding social costs, including applied examples on teen parenthood and homelessness.9 The NewSouth Wales Government has also committed to publishing unit cost data as part of their strategy.10Work in this area could build on existing efforts to developeffective performance management, such as OpenRBF (a tool11 and a standardized tool to cost early childhood interventions.124.Support awareness and knowledge sharing and information.terminology can be confusing.  The partnerships, the datacollection, setting metrics and payment mechanisms canbe new to commissioners and service providers and requireexplanation. These issues could be addressed by providingonline information and resources relevant to DIBs. Forfor Social Impact Bonds as a central resource for knowledgeand best practice for central and local government, deliverypartners, investors and intermediaries.At the global level, The Global Social Impact InvestmentSteering Group (GSG) was established in August 2015 asthe successor to the Social Impact Investment Taskforceestablished by the G8. The GSG works to catalyse a globalsocial impact investment market across its current 13 member countries plus the EU, as well as through active observers from government and leading network organisations supportiveof impact investment, including the OECD and the GlobalImpact Investing Network. The GSG is working to increaseincluding SIBs and DIBs, facilitating knowledge exchange and encouraging policy change in national markets.DIBs have great potential, and are particularly well suited to tackling some of Palestine™s most pressing social issues.

The ultimate test for SIBs and DIBs is to see if they deliver better outcomes for society and improve peoples™ lives.910 www.osii.nsw.gov.au1112The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared and edited by The Portland Trust.

Where do you source your production and packing inputs? In 1998 we franchised the production of Taybeh Beer in Germany to access European markets, following From there we source the German market and also export to other European countries. In 2005 we began exporting directly to Japan from Palestine, where all Carrefour stores now sell our beer, together with other Palestinian products. We are now also considering brewing Taybeh Beer in Jordan, after we had to stop exporting there due to a major increase in taxes by the Jordanian authorities. We are also exploring opportunities to brew Taybeh beer in the USA.Regarding inputs, we have to import everything but water: our malt comes from Belgium and France; hops from Bavaria and the Czech Republic; yeast from England and packaging material from Israel. We used to import bottles from Portugal but then shipping containers started to be repeatedly held in the Israeli port, for periods of up to 70 days. Because of this we had to face extra storage costs and custom fees (making a bottle originally costing 0.5 Israeli supplier.How do you see the prospects for the Palestinian economy?The current situation is very challenging but I am hopeful we will have a bright future if we achieve peace and stability.

Establishments closed down; there was no tourism and with no port or airport in Palestine and all of our inputs coming via Israel, we had to lay off staff and faced closure. I remember that many who had returned after Oslo closed their businesses and left Palestine.

From the beginning our company has been orientated towards tourism and we want to play an active role in the industry. Whilst I was Mayor of Taybeh from 2005 I helped create the Taybeh Oktoberfest. The festival has now run for eight years, attracting tourists from all over the world to visit Taybeh and to experience the culture, music, food and drink of Palestine. We also encourage those attending the festival to buy local products, including olive oil, honey, soap and embroidery. We hope that Oktoberfest will carry on for many years to come and that local tourism is further enhanced by the new hotel, which will be integrated with the winery and micro-brewery, as part of a broader agritourism offering in Taybeh.

Some of the largest Palestinian private sector players are partnering and sponsoring the event. In addition, international support is coming from USAID, DFID and the Islamic Development Bank.2The conference hopes to encourage business relations between regional and international investors and the Palestinian private sector. A number of announcements about new investment programmes and partnerships are anticipated. Details of the work being done to improve The Director General of PIPA, and the CEO of the conference, Jafaar Hdaib, told the Bulletin that ‚the event is an important milestone on the path to establishing the Palestinian State which is part of Prime Minister Dr. Salam Fayyad™s two-year plan ‚Ending the Occupation, Building the State™ (2009-2011). Palestinian companies to be showcased come from a variety of sectors, including manufacturing, tourism, IT, housing and construction, agriculture, energy and infrastructure. The agenda includes sectoral and plenary sessions, B2B meetings, cultural activities and off site visits. There will be a welcome reception and dinner on 1 June and Palestinian following day. An exhibition of Palestinian products will run alongside the main event.According to Hdaib 1,100 foreign participants have registered for the conference, far exceeding expectations. Over half of registered participants are the heads or general managers of the companies they represent. Around 540 are coming from the Arab world, 200 from Europe, the US and Canada and the remaining 360 are Palestinian Diaspora. PIPA and the PA are making logistical arrangements to ease participants™ entry to Bethlehem and applying for permits where necessary.1  See: http://www.pic-palestine.ps/ 2 For details of PIC partners and sponsors See: http://www.pic-palestine.ps/etemplate.php?id=86Private sector credit from the banking sector was $1.56bn at the end of January 2010, up from $1.18bn at the end of December 2008. The loan to deposit ratio was 36%, up from 31% at the end of January 2009.28 out of 36 companies were recorded by PALTEL ($23.2m).According to Paltrade there has been a 52% increase in the number of trucks leaving the West Bank with exports compared to last year. PCBS forecast that the value of exports will increase 3.4% this year. Support for the PA budget has recently been provided by the UK ($25m), the EU ($10m) and Algeria ($26m).The baseline scenario assumes the situation in the Palestinian Territory remains the same as 2009. It forecasts a 4.2% increase in real GDP, a 1.3% increase in GDP per capita and that private investment will reach $1,454m.If there was political and economic progress in 2010 then the PCBS expects real GDP to increase by 8.8% and real GDP per capita by 5.8%. Private investment would increase by 6.5% to reach $1,484m. This optimistic scenario assumes a fully-funded reconstruction effort in the Gaza Strip, an increase in the number of Palestinian workers employed in Israel, ongoing support for the PA budget and increased implementation of investment and development projects in the Palestinian Territory.However if political and economic conditions deteriorate, and external donor support falls, the PCBS predicts a 6% contraction in real GDP, an 8.6% fall in real GDP per capita and a drop in private investment of 2.8%.A comparison between the 2009 forecast and actual results shows that GDP growth of 6.8% in 2009 far exceeded even the optimistic forecast (3.2% growth). The IMF baseline and pessimistic forecasts published in the Bulletin last month are comparable to the PCBS optimistic and baseline scenario respectively. The IMF did not publish an optimistic scenario.24 Listings on the PSEThere are now 40 companies listed on the Palestine Securities Exchange (PSE).

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsBulletin 138March 2018Economic Developments in GazaThe combination of episodes of war, restrictions on the entry and exit of people and goods and internal challenges have taken a toll on Gaza™s economy. The most recent data reveals GDP growth of only 0.5% in Gaza during 2017. Unemployment reached 44% during the same period, despite a low labour participation rate of 75% for males and 18% for females. The quality of life for most Gaza residents is deteriorating, especially as access to basic utilities and services has continued to decline.1 Electricity ShortageBy 6 February 2018, emergency electricity generators ran out of fuel in three out of Gaza™s 13 hospitals and 14 out of its 54 medical centres.2 On 14 February, the Gaza supply of diesel fuel required to operate the plant.3 The possibility of additional medical facilities shutting down due to the lack of electricity was averted through a $3.5m donation towards emergency fuel supplies from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and the State of Qatar. The donation covers 54% of the $6.5m required for the most critical medical facilities to continue their operations in 2018.4While the GPP™s total capacity is 140 MW, since 22 January 2018, it has produced at most 25 MW of electricity. The lack of fuel to operate the plant is mainly due to political and funding disputes which impact the provision of fuel imported from Egypt.5 Housing ShortageHasayneh announced that Gaza requires about 125,000 new housing units to meet current demand, in addition to 24,000 existing housing units that require full reconstruction.614,000 housing units each year on average. Currently, there are 285,000 housing units in Gaza, of which 55,000 need restoration or rehabilitation, while 20% of the Palestinian families in Gaza live in densely populated residential units with population growth rates of at least 3.3%.7 Gaza Reconstruction MechanismA joint review of the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism (GRM) has been agreed between the Government of Israel (GoI) and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) following a meeting on 14 February with Palestinian Prime Minister Dr. Rami Hamdallah, the GoI™s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), Major General Yoav Mordechai, and United Nations (UN) Special Coordinator Mr. 1 https://bit.ly/2DPE6aM 2 https://reut.rs/2HYAV2W 34567On 1 March 2018, the North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment Facility in Brussels on the Gaza Central Desalination Plant on 20 March 2018, raising •456m for what will be the biggest ever infrastructure On 13 March 2018, the Reconstruction and a $5m loan to Cairo Amman Palestinian businessesto study the use of social media in Palestine, released Social and Digital Media in Palestine during 2017The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

A standing clause in the Palestinian budget stipulates that ﬁshould we receive additional external budget support, we will allocate it to the repayment of arrears.ﬂ 4 Since disbursed foreign aid has always been less than promised, the PA has been unable to pay old bills.With its limited resources, the PA has established priorities for its outgoing often funded by the EC and European countries.

The baseline scenario forecasts a 3.1% decrease in real GDP, a 5.9% decrease in GDP per capita and a decrease in both exports and imports by 8.2% and 5.8% respectively. This assumes that the situation in the Palestinian Territory remains as it was in 2008. The Islamic National Bank opened in Gaza on 21 April, making it the Palestinian Monetary Authority control. The bank has capital of $20m and does not suffer problems of liquidity. The bank opened 6,000 personal accounts for civil servants, into which their salaries will be directly paid.Palestinian Electric Company year 2008 (up from $4.6m in 2007). It will distribute cash dividends to shareholders of 10% of capital.PCBS reported that the percentage of Palestinian businesses expecting production to rise over the medium term (six months) was 48.4% higher in the West Bank than those expecting a decline. Gazan businessmen were less optimistic. Only 8.7% more believed that there would be an improvement in the coming six months than those who anticipated a fall, a huge decrease from February 2009 (57.7%).

Expectations of businesses can be a leading indicator of GDP growth trends, as those that anticipate a decline in performance are less likely to invest and expand.Following a long-term trend, the survey also showed weak borrowing activity by industrial enterprises in Q4 2012 as virtually no businesses applied for a bank loan during the period.Moreover, the survey asked respondents about the institutional provision of services by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and private enterprises. The results show high levels of dissatisfaction with infrastructure and facilities in Gaza, room for improvement in the provision of reliable services to businesses in Gaza, an essential enabling factor to sustain economic growth in the long term. In the West Bank, businesses reported a much higher level of satisfaction with gap between the physical business environments in the two areas.

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 99December 2014Back to Business in GazaThe Palestinian Market Development Programme (PMDP) has recently announced a series of adjustments to its grants scheme in the Gaza Strip. The programme, funded by the UK Department for International Development and the European Union, aims to improve the competitiveness of the Palestinian private sector through technical assistance and matching grants. In response to the urgent needs of factories and other businesses that were affected during the latest war in Gaza, the PMDP has introduced ﬁGaza Back to Businessﬂ (GBB).1 Unlike traditional compensation schemes, GBB is speciÞcally aimed at assisting companies that have suffered physical damage and are facing challenges to resume their business operations. Helping the private sector in Gaza to recover after severe interruption of economic activity during the war is an absolute priority. More than 420 industrial enterprises were destroyed, 36,000 dunams of agricultural land were damaged and 13,000 greenhouses were partially or totally demolished. In the aftermath of the operation it was reported that up to 30,000 workers employed in affected establishments were unable to work. Through GBB more than 50 companies are expected to receive support in the next 6-9 months to Þnance maintenance services, conduct assessment studies, acquire inputs, buy and install machinery, repair and reconstruct facilities, rent space for temporary relocation (for a period of up to 6 months) and cover labour and transport costs. The programme™s new window offers a Þxed grant of 75% of total funding needs (with the rest being covered by the beneÞciaries), in comparison to the original range of 25-75%. Grant ceilings per company will remain unchanged at £50,000. Priority will be given to businesses able to create signiÞcant impact in the short term while also delivering sustainable success beyond the period of assistance. Other criteria for eligibility focus on ease of implementation, including the availability of production inputs.In related news, after visiting Gaza on 11 December, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Mr Robert Serry, announced that pursuant to the trilateral agreement reached between the Palestinian Government, the Government of Israel and the UN earlier in September 2014, some 20,000 home owners in Gaza would have access to much needed building materials for the repair of their damaged homes by the end of the month.2 The UN-brokered mechanism aims to ensure that construction materials entering Gaza are exclusively used for their intended purpose, for which the UN has agreed to undertake checks to monitor compliance. The donor-funded mechanism has been subject to criticism by Palestinian businesses and individuals following delays in its effective implementation, with local sources reporting that the ßow of materials into Gaza has not improved consistently. While security concerns regarding the use of materials need to be addressed, some regard the different 1 www.pmdp.ps/page.php?id=984fy38991Y984f2 www.bit.ly/1vIMe0JAn MoU was signed between Palestine and Turkey for the establishment of an organised tax-free industrial zone in JeninGlobal Entrepreneurship Week was celebrated for a second consecutive year in Palestine, culminating with 10 start-ups pitching to local and international investorsInnovation Fund, the Þrst post-accelerator investment vehicle for Palestinian start-ups, was launchedQ3 2014 saw a signiÞcant decrease in hotel activities.

Arab Real Estate enjoyed the best performance, with its share price gaining 16.7%, while Global Telecommunications saw its price drop by 40%. A total of 13.7m shares worth $26.97m were traded in 21 PEX sessions during November.

The MoU was signed within the framework of StartUp Palestine, an innovative three-year programme to support micro and small entrepreneurship initiatives originating from marginalised sectors of Palestinian society. Financial services will be provided in the form of soft loans (•20m) and grants (•1.8m). The programme will work with the Union of Cooperative Associations for Saving and Credit, a representative body for saving and credit cooperatives in Palestine, to provide its members with structured Þnancial products and advisory services. It will also improve the capacity of the Palestinian Fund for Employment and Social Protection to provide Þnancial instruments and technical assistance (advisory and coaching services) to marginalised groups.Foreign TradeIn September, total exports of goods from Palestine amounted to $75.7m, while imports reached $423.1m.11 The trade deÞcit, at $347.4m, increased from the previous month (3.2%), as exports decreased by $5.1m (7.2%) and imports increased by $15.9m (3.9%).

The purpose of the changes is to create a more attractive investment climate in the Palestinian Territory, thereby further encouraging investment, increasing exports, creating jobs and supporting the development process.1 Preparation of the new law began after the second Palestine Investment Conference took place in Bethlehem June last year. Several workshops and sessions, led by the Ministry of National Economy, were held 2 One of the most important amendments aims to simplify investment procedures and reduce bureaucracy. The existing investment department has been reformed with representatives from the relevant ministries (including the Ministry of National Economy, Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Finance) playing a bigger role. This will facilitate the faster processing of important licenses and permits. The investment department will also be responsible for following up with investors and ministries as required. The Palestinian Investment Promotion Agency (PIPA) will also be reformed. The PIPA Board will be increased to include 17 members, seven of which will be representatives of private sector institutions and a representative of the Ministry of Local government.3 The amendments grant tax exemptions and incentives to new sectors such as real estate development and environmental projects as well as amending the terms of exemption for other sectors. For example, projects in the ICT sector are now granted tax exemptions based on the number of employees, not on the size of capital. Tourism, health and education projects are granted additional exemptions from customs duties and taxes on procurement of furniture and enjoy the same incentives and exemptions. if recommended by the PIPA Board and approved by the Council of Ministers.4 The minimum threshold for eligible investment projects has been raised to The law is yet to be put into effect, as this will follow a public information campaign about the new law, which will take place in Palestinian newspapers later in February or early March.

Real GDP is expected to increase by 0.5% and the GDP per capita to decrease by 2%. The unemployment rate is expected to stay high, at 31.5% in 2019. The Optimistic Scenario4 assumes an improved political and economic situation that allows for real GDP to increase by 5% during 2019 and GDP per capita to increase by 2%. Unemployment would fall back to 2017 levels of 29% during 2019. The Pessimistic Scenario,5 assumes a deteriorating political and economic situation where GDP is projected to decrease by 3% during 2019 and GDP per capita would decrease by 5%. The number of Palestinian employees in Israel would decrease by 12%, thus increasing unemployment to 33%.The PMA™s separate forecasting exercise largely corresponds to the projections of the PCBS. Despite the different methodologies and modelling techniques employed, both forecasts agree on the range of possible GDP outcomes and are 6 However, in the baseline scenario, PMA™s forecasts project slightly higher real GDP and per capita GDP growth prospects, based on its expectation that the same challenges constraining economic growth in 2018 would continue. Furthermore, the range between the PMA™s worst and best outlook is narrower than that forecasted by PCBS.1 Given the limitations in obtaining economic data from Gaza, the forcasts do not allow separate modelling of the West Bank and Gazan economies.2 www.pcbs.gov.ps/post.aspx?lang=en&ItemID=3341 3budget, declining clearance revenues from Israel, increased government transfers, income tax collection and value of credit facilities, continuing restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries and population growth (birth and mortality rates) in Palestine remaining at current levels.4 Optimistic scenario economic and political assumptions based on political reconciliation between the West Bank and Gaza, reconstruction of Gaza and donor support for Government budget, increased clearance revenues increased development expenditure, decreased restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries, and population  (birth and mortality rates) growth below current levels.5 Pessimistic scenario economic and political assumptions based on decreased donor support for Government clearance value added taxes, decrease in income tax collection, and a decrease in development expenditures, increased restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries and the number of workers in Israel decreasing.6The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) published its preliminary estimates on the performance of the Palestinian Economy in 2018The Private Sector Coordination Council calls for an emergency economic development programme for GazaOn 23 December 2018, the PCBS published its Balance of Payments and International Investment Position reports for the third quarter of 2018On an annual basis, the Al-Quds index decreased by 7.9% compared to the last day of trading in 2017The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsBulletin 151April 2019PMA Strategy to Expand Electronic Transactions in PalestineOn 30 March, the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), announced the launch of a strategy to increase the use of electronic transactions and reduce the reliance on cash in the Palestinian economy. The strategy was prepared by the PMA in cooperation with the banking sector and other stakeholders and was approved by the Palestinian Cabinet in mid-2018. the use of electronic payment methods in local transactions, in both the private and the public sectors. This includes the launch of a system that will allow for the automated electronic transfer of the wages of Palestinian workers in Israel directly to their personal bank accounts on a monthly basis and with minimal fees.1 The PMA will also work to allow the use of electronic payment cards issued by Israeli banks for purchases by Palestinians from Israel in local markets. According to the Governor  of the PMA, Mr Azzam Al Shawwa, the accumulation of New Israeli Shekels (NIS) in the Palestinian market is mainly caused by the excessive reliance on cash in local economic transactions, in addition to cash payment of the wages of  around130,000 Palestinian workers in Israel (a monthly average of around NIS 600 million), and the purchases made by Palestinian Israeli citizens when they visit the West Bank, estimated by the PMA at an average of NIS 250 million monthly.2 One of the main goals of the strategy is to curb the accumulation of Israeli Shekels in circulation in Palestine, due to the negative impact of the surplus on the stability of the Palestinian banking system and the Palestinian economy.3 The build-up of cash, mostly in shekels, in Palestinian markets is particularly costly to imposed on Palestinian banks by the Government of Israel (GoI).4 Any excess cash beyond the ceiling imposed by the GoI (currently limited to one billion Shekels per month5) continues to be retained within the Palestinian banking system with large quantities of cash, the loss of potential interest on cash (above permitted transfer ceilings) that might otherwise be deposited in Israeli banks, and the holdings by Palestinian banks of excessive surplus capital leading to a drag on their return on equity (ROE). 1 www.pma.ps/Default.aspx?tabid=205&ArtMID=793&ArticleID=2380&language=en-US 2 Around NIS 3 billion annually: these unrecorded ﬁexportsﬂ to Palestinian consumers from Israel are approximately equivalent in value to the total annual registered Palestinian merchandise exports to Israel.

The PCBS has estimated that the unemployment rate reached 28.5% during 2017, an increase from 27.3% in 2016.6 7 This estimate is higher than the December 2016 baseline scenario forecasts by the PCBS (27.2%) and the PMA (27.6%).Despite the worrying political and economic prospects, there were a number of positive developments in the Palestinian economy during 2017.8Strategic ProjectsDuring 2017, the Palestinian private sector led by Palestine™s national sovereign fund, the Palestine Investment Fund (PIF), commenced three strategic projects which aim to reduce resource-dependency on Israel and achieve energy security.plant in Jenin, with a total investment of over $600m and a capacity of 450 MW. The construction of the plant, which began in 2017, is expected to be completed by June 2020.9In November 2017, Massader Company, PIF™s investment subsidiary for energy and infrastructure, launched the Tubas Solar Power Plant, an $11 million investment to bring 8 MW of solar capacity to the residential, agricultural and industrial sectors in the Tubas Governorate.10In a joint project, the PIF and the Jordanian Manaseer Group are leading the investment of around $310m.

The bottom line is that the peace process is extremely important, period. The upside of a just peace can only be good for both sides in terms of sustainability, stability and employment. The opportunity is simply too big and too positive to be ignored. Efforts by President Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are by far the largest, solution I have ever seen. Our hope is that the solution will be fair and balanced and uphold all the principles and values of freedom, equality and human rights.

Instead, banks are required to reduce the ratio of foreign investments to total deposits from 65% to 55% by September 2009.1 The new regulations are intended to expand the size of local investments without imposing minimum lending requirements. It is hoped that it will increase credit facilities provided by local banks to the private sector. In Q3 2008, there was $6.3bn in total deposits but only $1.8bn in total loans (a 28% loan to deposit ratio). Mohammed Manasrah, from the Companies Monitoring Department at the PMA, told the Bulletin that effects of the new regulations had already been 2009 while credit facilities increased by $44m during the same period.  Osama Kasbari from the loan-guarantee fund department at CHF explained to the of their local loans. He also expects a rise in the use of the CHF administered Loan Guarantee Facility (LGF). The Loan Guarantee Facility has approved 72 loans since it was set up, totalling $27.5m. Nine loans were approved in February 2009. An additional 34 loans totalling $13.8m are in various stages of processing. The LGF portfolio (net of cancellations) consisted of 62 loans totalling $25.7m. It is estimated that the loans will generate approximately 2,690 new jobs.77% of LGF approved loans are between $10,000 and $200,000. But there is a growing demand for much larger transactions and there are 3 requests for $1m and above in the pipeline. The LGF portfolio is becoming more evenly distributed throughout the West Bank, although Nablus and the other northern governorates still constitute more than 50% of the portfolio. 13% of the portfolio is now in the Ramallah vicinity. Nearly 70% of the loans are distributed to businesses in urban areas. General Manager and the Board of Directors will recommend to the bank™s general assembly on 24 April that it distributes stock dividends to its shareholders. 21 See: http://www.al-ayyam.ps/znews/site/template/article.aspx?did=106706&date=3/11/2009 (Arabic)2 See: http://www.sahem-inv.com/news.php?id=614&month=1 Israeli Arabs will be able to access Nablus, Tulkarm and Jenin by car on Saturdays by the end of April.

According to recent estimates by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) and the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), real GDP (2015 prices) increased by 1.2% during 2019, which GDP per capita decreased by 1.3%.1 Growth in 2019 was driven by a 3.6% growth in Q4 2019 following the release of clearance revenues, otherwise, the economy crisis. Growth in Q4 2019 was mainly the result of an increase in the value added of construction (17%) and services activities (8%).Economic performance in 2019 was better than had been forecasted by both the PMA and PCBS at the beginning of the year with GDP above the baseline projection (Table 1).  In particular, unemployment decreased from 26.8% in 2018 to 26%, even earlier PMA projections of 0.7%.2have been powered by an external shock rather than structural change or resilience within the economy. Among these possible external factors was a 9.3% increase in Palestinians gaining employment in Israel during Q3 20193 compared to Q2 2019 and Q3 2018, reaching 140,800.4Palestinian workers in Israel (with and without permits) are even higher.

Due to the downturn in business activity, rising uncertainty, and closures to combat the pandemic, the livelihoods of many families in Palestine are at risk with tens of thousands of families sinking into poverty. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) recently published the results of a survey it had conducted to assess socio-economic changes and found worrying results.1 The survey examined a sample of 9,926 households, and covered the lockdown period of 5 March - 25 May. For some, the economic situation has improved since then as the government eased pandemic-related movement restrictions. While the spread of the virus has been on a downward trend during October, brief local lockdowns have been required in some areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to slow the rate of infection. The assessment of the Spring 2020 lockdown provides important indicators of the perilous impacts of any possible future generalised lockdowns. Work and incomeAccording to the survey results, the main income earners of 14% of Palestinian households ceased working during the lockdown, while 13% were already unemployed prior to the pandemic. The remainder continued to work, however 54% were absent from work during lockdown (unable to work due to lockdown but still employed). The majority (51%) of those who stopped working were from the industrial sector, while 7% were from the agricultural sector. The results do not specify the percentages for other sectors.As a result of the interruption to work during lockdown, only 23% of main income earners who work as wage employees continued to receive their normal wage, 25% received a reduced wage, and 52% received no wage at all (95% of which were in the private sector). The impact was more severe in the West Bank, with 61% of wage employees not receiving any income, compared to 31% in Gaza, where the spread of COVID-19 - and consequently lockdown measures - was much more limited in that period. Due to the decline in work and wages, 42% of households witnessed their income decrease by half or more during lockdown compared to February/March (46% in the West Bank and 38% in Gaza). Almost two thirds (63%) of households could only cover their expenses for a month or less if the lockdown was renewed, and only 10% could cover their expenses for four months or more. The survey also revealed that 58% of Palestinian households usually borrow money or buy on credit to cover household consumption, including food and other basic expenditure. This percentage increased to 63% during the lockdown and as a result, 41% of households decreased their food expenditure compared to February/March.Access to servicesAccording to the PCBS, approximately 4% of households that required health services were unable to access them; 39% of them because the health centres and 1 http://pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_Ar_4-10-2020-covid-ar.pdf Ł Agricultural sector: small-scale farmers should receive subsidies within the next year.

Of these, 4 died, 95 people have recovered, and the majority of the remainder are asymptomatic.1 impact on various economic sectors in Palestine. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) expects a $2.5bn (13.5%) decrease in GDP compared to its baseline projection for 2020 assuming that the closures continue until end of May.2 Under this scenario, private and public consumption are expected to decrease by a total of $1.3bn (5.2%), and investment by $2.1bn (43.4%). The PCBS projects that the services sector will be the most affected by the crises, with possible losses of around $1.2bn, followed by the industrial sector ($362), construction ($220m) and agriculture ($200m).The Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) foresees an even larger impact on the economy, using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model that compares two different scenarios.3closure measures would not be fully relaxed before the mid-May, GDP is expected to decline by 20.3%, due to a demand-side shock driven by a decrease in private and public spending (by 21.8% and 15.3% respectively). In the second scenario, which assumes an extension of the closure and gradual recovery for an additional month and a half (until end June), GDP is expected to decline by over 35%, driven by a further decrease in private and public spending (33.2% and 20% respectively). Unemployment is expected to increase from 25% in 20194and to 36.5% in the second. MAS projections also estimate the impact to Gross National Income (GNI) resulting from the loss of income from labour in the Israeli market, forecasting a contraction of at least 25% in GNI.Table 1: Projected Losses due to the COVID-19 crisis, 2020 MASPCBSOrganisationClosure until end of JuneClosure until mid-May Closure until end of MayScenario-35%-20.3%-13.5%Gross Domestic Product-33.2%-21.8%-5.2%Private Spending-20%-15.3%Government Spending-38.1%-26.3%-43.4%Gross Capital Formation (Investment level)-17.2%-1.2%-2%Exports-22.5%-17.2%-7.8%Imports-32.8%-23.9%-Government Revenue-24.6%-17.2%-EmploymentSource: PCBS and MASThe Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), also provided its own estimates on the impact of the current crisis.5the continuation of the closure until the end of June and the second until the end of August. For each scenario, the PMA offers a quarter-by-quarter prediction of the impact of the crisis based on key economic indicators. These estimates are more optimistic than those presented by the PCBS and MAS, largely because they were modeled at an earlier period in the crisis and only focus on major economic aggregates.1 www.corona.ps/2 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_23-4-2020-forc-en.pdf3 MAS Economic Monitor Œ Special Supplement, forthcoming, May 2020, https://bit.ly/2S5mktT 4 https://bit.ly/2ztlpNx5 https://bit.ly/2K9y9uH construction sector might incur if Palestinian workers restrictions on the entry of 65,000 Palestinians working in the Israeli construction sector would lead to delays in the delivery of around 70,000 apartments, which is expected to cause a monthly loss of ILS 4.56 billion ($1.18 billion) in GDP.37As the borders with Jordan and Egypt have been closed for over Palestine is Israel, which has experienced higher transmission rates with 15,782 cases as of 29 April.38 The majority of cases (77%) in the West Bank are among workers returning from Israel,39 with community transmission mostly limited to workers™ families and those who were in direct contact with them.40 The daily overcrowding at crossings and checkpoints, contact with Israeli employers, and daily movement between the West Bank and Israel are all factors that also may be leading to a faster spread of the virus among the workers.41With no control over entry into the West Bank and limited cooperation by Israeli authorities, the GoP is struggling to stop the movement of workers into and out of the West Bank. The Palestinian Ministry of Health deployed testing teams behind Israeli checkpoints, however, systematic tracking has been weak since many workers cross through unmonitored areas.42Workers in Israel are a major source of income for the Palestinian economy, providing subsistence for tens of thousands of families, and stimulating local consumption. 43 The average worker in Israel earns more than double the average wage in the West Bank. In 2019, there were 133,000 Palestinians working in Israel and Israeli settlements, generating $2.55bn in income (15% of GDP).44 ﬁWaqfet Izz™™ FundOn 6 April, the board of the newly founded ﬁWaqfet Izz™™ board, consisting of 30 Palestinian business leaders, began the impact of COVID-19.

On 9 April, the European Union (EU) announced an assistance pandemic.48 The EU welcomed the preventive measures taken so far by the GoP. The assistance package, which also includes humanitarian aid, is a direct response to the GoP™s COVID-19 Response Plan  and commits •49.5m to Healthcare (including six East Jerusalem hospitals), •5.5m to SMEs, •5m to vulnerable communities, and •10,9m for humanitarian aid including UN agencies, UNRWA, and NGOs. On 2 April, the World Bank Group (WBG) approved a new $5m emergency operation to help Palestine address urgent healthcare needs.49 This funding follows a previous reallocation of $800,000 which the World Bank approved on 6 March 2020 as an immediate support to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Other nations have also responded to requests for support. China supplied 10,000 coronavirus testing kits to Palestine, Turkey offered medical assistance to Gaza, and the United States pledged $5m in support.50 March TradingOn 22 March, the Palestine Capital Market Authority (PCMA) suspended trade in Palestine Exchange (PEX), in light of the government™s decision to enforce closure measures.51 On April 21, PCMA decided to resume trading as of 3 May 2020 based on the latest government decision for a gradual lifting of the curfew.52Al-Quds Index witnessed a steady decrease throughout March, falling to 498.9 points (6.6% drop) on the last day of trading.

The delivery of funds is uncertain, especially since the announced resignation of Prime Minister Fayyad and his Government on 7 March and the lack of progress on a National Unity Government. Seven weeks after the military operation, 90% of Gazans still need food aid and many people are in temporary accommodation.  Demand for rental apartments is sky-high, in particular since UNRWA™s schools reopened and children returned to their classes. Rents have risen as much as 150%, according to the local population1. Basic necessities such as cooking gas canisters and washing powder are hard to come by. $4.4bn was pledged for the Palestinian Authority (PA) at the Gaza Reconstruction 2 Among the of $900m (of which $300m will be directed to Gaza reconstruction), $553m from the EU and $42m from the UK. A complete breakdown of pledges is not yet clear. At the conference, the PA asked for $1.6bn to cover the Gaza reconstruction costs and supplementary budget support requirements ($1.15bn for general budget support had already been requested.) A needs assessment for Gaza was presented by the PA at the conference. The plan focused on early re-covery projects and medium-to-longer term reconstruction interventions. ﬁOur goal is not only to restore the pre-war situation in Gaza, but to create a decent standard of living,ﬂ said the Prime Minister, Salam Fayyad.3 Infrastructure (water and sanitation, housing and power networks) and medical and school facilities will be completely rebuilt.

This amount, which will be paid in 48 equal installments, represents the balance of the NIS 2bn debt which the PNA had accumulated over more than a decade, before the parties reached an agreement in September 2016 to restructure relations between the Government of Israel (GoI) and the PNA with respect to electricity provision and consumption.1Under the terms of the 2016 agreement, which aims to position the PNA as the sole body responsible for electricity distribution across the West Bank, the PNA agreed to pay NIS 500m ($132m) of the debt to the IEC immediately, while another NIS 1bn was agreed to be paid in installments. A remaining balance of NIS 500m was permanently erased from the debt.The May agreement, which is currently pending approval by the IEC Board and Israeli regulators, also sets terms for the sale of power to the PETC over the next 15 years and includes collateral and a guarantee mechanism to ensure that the IEC is paid. The agreement provides for the IEC to supply the PETC with NIS 2.8bn ($775m) worth of power transmission annually, via four high-voltage substations that will be built in Jalama, Nablus, Ramallah and Tarqumiya in the coming years by the IEC and the PNA. This arrangement will enable the PETC to take charge of electricity distribution in the West Bank in line with the 2016 agreement.collecting dues from customers across the West Bank and Gaza. Most Palestinian power distribution companies, municipalities and local councils do not pay the full amount for electricity consumed citing high default rates by consumers or high theft rates as the reason for their inability to fully pay the IEC. To recover part of the debt to the IEC, the GoI has in the past made deductions from the customs duties it collects on behalf of the PNA at Israeli ports.2Palestine currently receives more than 86% of its electricity from Israel, making it the single largest customer of the IEC.  Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Mr. Hussein Al-Sheikh, announced in a written statement that ﬁThe agreement ... frees the Palestinian electricity sector of complete Israeli control, which has lasted for decades.ﬂ 3  Growing Number of Rejected Cheques in PalestineOn 24 April, the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) hosted representatives and experts from the public, private, and legal sectors to discuss 1 https://bit.ly/2JiHLoi2 https://bit.ly/2kwi99p3 https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Israel-to-transfer-much-of-West-Bank-electric-grid-to-Palestinians-553248Main reportsThe Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

The plan, entitled ﬁPeace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli Peopleﬂ (PtP), was announced in two parts.1 The political component was released on 28 January, seven months after the publication of the economic component in June 2019.2 Palestinian political, business and civil society leadership immediately rejected the plan on the grounds that it disregards Palestinian rights to a viable, independent and sovereign state.  sectors.  MAS presented its position paper on the potential implications of the deal, followed by a panel discussion. The economic component of the plan promised $50 billion in new investments over 10 years in Palestine ($28bn), Jordan ($7.5bn), Egypt ($9bn) and Lebanon ($6bn).3 According to the US Administration, successful implementation of the proposed investment plan under PtP would double Palestinian GDP, reduce the unemployment rate to single digits and bring down poverty by half.4 MAS concluded that despite the large sums of promised investment, the Vision poses an existential threat to the viability of the Palestinian economy and constrains the space available for economic activity and investment. Participants highlighted concerns that under the plan Israel will also continue to control all Palestinian water resources (the Dead Sea, Jordan River and groundwater), airspace, cyberspace and trade. Loss of Territory and Resourcesannexation to Israel of the entirety of the Jordan Valley, which is the most fertile 5 It also does not allow for a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem.The concept maps included in the plan suggest that two Palestinian zones would be established in Israeli territory in  the Negev desert near the Gaza Strip; a high-tech manufacturing industrial zone and a residential agricultural zone. These areas would be separated from the Egyptian border by a narrow area controlled by Israel.6Panelists viewed these aspects as a tightening and institutionalising of the restrictions that are currently imposed on the Palestinian economy. Mr Osama Amer, Secretary of the Private Sector Coordinating Council and a speaker on the panel, reiterated ﬁthe political or economic prospects for Palestinians.ﬂ He explained that the Palestinian economy™s potential gains from the proposed plan ($28bn over 10 years) are negligible when compared to economic gains from ending existing restrictions on the Palestinian C™ cost the economy around $3.4bn annually, while recent UNCTAD estimates put PNA 7 12 www.whitehouse.gov/peacetoprosperity/3 https://bit.ly/2JKMXPJ ; https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/middleeast/peace-plan.html4 www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MEP_programsandprojects.pdf5 www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Peace-to-Prosperity-0120.pdf6 https://bit.ly/3d8mB8s; https://politi.co/33mZoe1  7 https://bit.ly/2vsMpLk; https://bit.ly/3dnvPxL\n",

This is up from 18.7% in Q2 2011 but marks a decline from 26.6% compared with the same period last year.1higher than in the West Bank (19.7%), although it is much lower compared to Q3 2010 when it was around 40%, as the following graph shows.GazaPTWest BankQ1 2005Q2 2005Q3 2005Q4 2005Q1 2006Q2 2006Q3 2006Q4 2006Q1 2007Q2 2007Q3 2007Q4 2007Q1 2008Q2 2008Q3 2008Q4 2008Q1 2009Q2 2009Q3 2009Q4 2009Q1 2010Q2 2010Q3 2010Q4 2010Q1 2011Q2 2011Q3 2011101520253035404550Figure 1: Unemployment in the Palestinian Territory (%)Source: PCBSPalestinian women faced an unemployment rate of 30.5%, an increase of 1.9 percentage points since Q2, while 43.4% of Gazan women seeking a job among Palestinian women with 13 or more years of schooling. This high number illustrates a structural problem in the Palestinian economy which is failing to provide work for highly educated women.In the West Bank the governorates of Tulkarm (28.5%) and Qalqilia (26.0%) had the worst unemployment rates; in Gaza, Rafah had the highest (34.1%).Low labour force participation, at 43.6%, presents another ongoing problem for the labour market and the economy as a whole. Only 39% was recorded in Gaza for Q3. For comparison the rate for both Jordan and Egypt in 2009 was 49%.2 Despite various initiatives documented in previous issues of the Bulletin, women continue to suffer from a disproportionately low participation rate of 16.7% compared to 70.0% for men.3 In Gaza, only 13.2% of women were in the labour force.

This is the second stage of a plan, launched banks to increase their capital from a minimum of $20m to $35m by the end of this year. There are currently 10 local banks and 11 foreign banks operating in the West Bank and 46 in the Gaza Strip. The combined capital of all banks is approximately $900m. All foreign banks, and 26% of local Palestinian banks, of the PMA™s Governor, explained to the Bulletin that if banks are unable to merge with others as part of an effort to rationalise the number of banks™. In a further effort to reduce banking risks the PMA announced, on 12 October, that by the beginning of 2010 it will launch a new computerised older, manual system that blacklisted clients who bounced more than 15 bounced with a value of approximately $250m.2launched in Spring 2010. By the end of November, the PMA expects to contract a German company, ‚Credit Info™, to calculate credit scores for all banking clients in the Palestinian Territory. Scores will be based on information available on the credit registry system, including a client™s record of borrowing, timely payment of bills and loan history.3 The new system will help banks speed up their credit decisions and enable the PMA to keep track of who is taking credit from different banks. It is based on US Credit Bureau, which began in March 2008. 1 Basel II is the internationally agreed standard for bank regulators which recommends that banks hold capital reserves appropriate for their exposure to risk. 23 See Bulletin July 2008 for background on the credit registry system.Palestinian technology week took place on 2 Œ 6 November. 250 local and international IT companies participated in a conference people visited the exhibition throughout the week.

However, the new license allows the company to install a wider network infrastructure that extends coverage and services throughout the entire area (up to 60% of the territory of the West Bank).2 The installation of such infrastructure will result in Israeli providers to offer Palestinian residents in the West Bank more advanced Israeli cellular services for cheaper prices than available through Palestinian networks, creating a ﬁdigital gapﬂ and unfair competition between the Palestinian and Israeli telecommunications sectors.The Government of Israel (GoI) currently limits Palestinian access to the electromagnetic sphere, and controls imports of ICT equipment.3 Granting Bezeq the license to operate fully and legally on Palestinian land, while denying Palestinian telecommunication companies from expanding their networks in Area C, leaves Palestinian residents with no alternatives to Israeli service providers.4 This includes up to 300,000 Palestinians living in those areas, and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who commute through Area C on a daily basis.5 Palestinian telecom companies are prohibited from building switches6 in Area A, which is supposed to be under sole PA control under the Oslo accords.7The Palestinian Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology (MTIT) condemned the GoI™s decision, describing it as a ﬁcontinuation of the occupation of the Palestinian economyﬂ. MTIT added that Israeli operators held 16% of the West Bank market share in 2019, with the number of Palestinian subscribers reaching one million this year.8incurred a consequent revenue loss of around $63m in 2019. Furthermore, Israeli telecommunication companies operate with impunity whilst ignoring the basic mandatory operational legalities such as obtaining licenses and paying fees and taxes to the Palestinian Government. The World Bank estimated that Palestinian telecom companies incurred total revenue losses between $436m and $1.1bn in the period 2013-2015 alone, with the direct impact of the occupation equivalent to 3% of the GDP at the time.9Authority was estimated at between $70m and $184m in the period 2013-2015.Despite such limitations, the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector is among the fastest growing sectors in Palestine. In the last two decades, the ICT sector grew by over 250%, hiring approximately 6,760 workers in 2018. In 2019, it was estimated that the sector contributed $530m to the Palestinian market (3.1% of GDP).101 https://bit.ly/36STcMY 2 www.jpost.com/israel-news/bezeq-operating-license-for-area-c-formalized-after-36-years-646149 3 https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/ict-the-shackled-engine-of-palestines-development/ 4 https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24019/104263.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y 5 https://bit.ly/2V4X4oZ/ https://bit.ly/35UKCOu 6 Devices for making and breaking connection in an electric circuit; it is the heart of any telecommunications 7 https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/ict-the-shackled-engine-of-palestines-development/8 www.maannews.net/news/2021865.html 9 https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24019/104263.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y 10 www.pcbs.gov.ps/statisticsIndicatorsTables.aspx?lang=en&table_id=163 Palestine Economic DashboardGrowthGDP (in million USD) and GDP Per Capita (in USD) in Palestine, Q1 2015 Œ Q1 2020 GDPGDP per capitaQ1 2015Q2 2015Q3 2015Q4 2015Q1 2016Q2 2016Q3 2016Q4 2016Q1 2017Q2 2017Q3 2017Q4 2017Q1 2018Q2 2018Q3 2018Q4 2018Q1 2019Q2 2019Q3 2019Q4 2019Q1 20203300340035003700380036003900400041004200760740780800820840860880900GDP (Q1 2020): $3,820.4m      GDP per capita (Q1 2020): $802Source: PCBSUnemploymentUnemployment and Youth Unemployment in Palestine,  Q1 2015 Œ Q3 2020Youth Unemployment UnemploymentQ1 2015Q2 2015Q3 2015Q4 2015Q1 2016Q2 2016Q3 2016Q4 2016Q1 2017Q2 2017Q3 2017Q4 2017Q1 2018Q2 2018Q3 2018Q4 2018Q1 2019Q2 2019Q3 2019Q4 2019Q1 2020Q2 2020Q3 20202030405060Unemployment rate(Q3 2020): 28.5%           Youth Unemployment rate (Q3 2020): 46.6%Source: PCBSConsumer Price Index (Base year = 2010), January 2015 Œ October 2020 PalestineWest BankGazaJerusalem, J1                                                  Jan-15Mar-15May-15Jul-15Sep-15Nov-15Jan-16Mar-16May-16Jul-16Sep-16Nov-16Jan-17Mar-17May-17Jul-17Sep-17Nov-17Jan-18Mar-18May-18Jul-18Sep-18Nov-18Jan-19Mar-19May-19Jul-19Sep-19Dec-19Jan-20Apr-20May-20Jul-20Sep-20Oct-209095100105110115120Palestine (October  2020): 112.8                                  West Bank (October 2020): 117.9Gaza (October  2020): 102.3           Source: PCBSTradeQ1 2015 Œ Q1 2020 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Q1 2015Q2 2015Q3 2015Q4 2015Q1 2016Q2 2016Q3 2016Q4 2016Q1 2017Q2 2017Q3 2017Q4 2017Q1 2018Q3 2018Q4 2018Q1 2019Q2 2019Q3 2019Q4 2019Q1 2020Q2 2018Imports (Q1 2020): $1,296.7m                               Exports (Q1 2020): $230.6mBusiness Cycle IndexPalestine Monetary Authority Business Cycle Index, January 2015 ŒOctober 2020 PalestineWest BankGazaJan - 15Apr - 15Jul - 15Oct - 15Jan - 16Apr - 16Jul - 16Oct - 16Jan - 17Apr - 17Jul - 17Oct - 17Jan - 18Apr - 18Jul - 18Oct - 18Jan - 19Apr - 19Jul - 19Oct - 19Dec-19Jan - 20Apr - 20Jun - 20Jul - 20Aug-20Oct - 20-80-60-40-2002040Palestine  (October 2020): -29.8                         West Bank (October 2020): -26.4Gaza (October 2020): -37.9          Source: PMABanking SectorUSD), Q1 2015 Œ Q3 2020 Total Deposits TotQ1 2015Q2 2015Q3 2015Q4 2015Q1 2016Q2 2016Q3 2016Q4 2016Q1 2017Q2 2017Q3 2017Q4 2017Q1 2018Q2 2018Q3 2018Q4 2018Q1 2019Q2 2019Q3 2019Q4 2019Q1 2020Q2 2020Q3 2020400060008000100001200014000Total Credit (Q3 2020): $9,894m             Total Deposits (Q3 2020): $14,061.9mSource: PMA\n",

The Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Israeli Government agreed in May 2008 that Israel would release the necessary frequencies for Wataniya Mobile operations and services. The Quartet Representative said at the time, ﬁthe Government of Israel  has agreed to [–] release a frequency of 2.4 MHz in the 900 bandwidth. The Government of Israel will commit, in writing, that within 6 to 8 months, the assignment of frequency will be amended to a total bandwidth of 4.8 MHz at the 900/1800 MHz bands and will assign a frequency of more than 4.8 MHz in due course, 1 To date the necessary frequencies have not been released.Wataniya Mobile planned to launch their mobile service provision in April 2009. Allan Richardson, CEO of Wataniya Mobile said that Wataniya has been unable to launch its operations because Israel had not abided by the frequency agreement. He added that some of the company™s essential equipment remains held up at Israeli Customs.The Palestinian Minister of Telecommunications and Information Technology (MTIT), Dr. Mashhour Abu Daka, told the Bulletin that Israel is pushing Jawwal and Wataniya to use a 1,800MH frequency and abandon the 900MH frequency. However, 900MH is more cost effective and has a wider coverage area than 1,800MH. This range requires fewer materials for installation (towers, cables etc.) and incurs fewer overall costs. Telecommunications companies on the whole prefer 900MH for 3G services. If Wataniya does secure a frequency and Jawwal also shifts to using 1800MH, the Israeli telecommunications companies, still operating at 900MH, will be able to offer more affordable and better services. ‚Israel is acting in a way that is contrary to supporting an open market economy, working to strengthen the competitive advantage of the Israeli telecommunications companies as two new regional companies enter the Palestinian market™, Abu Daka added.The withdrawal of Wataniya would put the PA in a critical situation. It could lose $354m which was paid by Wataniya Mobile for license fees, and another $200m in expenses spent on installing equipment and running costs. 3,000 jobs would be lost.2 The international community is continuing to put pressure on Israel to facilitate Palestinian telecommunications sector expansion,3 and the release of frequences and equipment.1 See: l 2 See: http://www.9 3 See: http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE55F3RR20090616 The joint Palestinian-Israeli economic committee is expected to reconvene before the end of July, after years of inaction. The Palestinians will press Israel to release frequencies for Wataniya Mobile, allow Palestinian products into Jerusalem, open borders in the Gaza Strip and renew the Palestinian Businessmen Cards.The Palestine Islamic Bank renewed its agreement this month with Israel™s Discount Bank to clear cheques, SWIFT transactions, money transfers and cash deposits on its behalf in Israel.PCBS launched their new National Strategy for the Development of Statistics, which should raise the quality of data produced by the statistical system while improving the dissemination and PCBS reports that GDP increased by 3.9% in Q1 2009 compared to Q4 2008.

Amr Hamd, Gaza General Manager of the Palestinian Federation of Industries, explained that the lack of liquidity in the banks in Gaza is prohibiting companies from meeting commercial agreements. Cash is not available in the banks and the vast majority of businessmen cannot leave Gaza or transfer money to or from Israel or the West Bank. Money transfers from banks in Gaza to Israel require special permission which is almost impossible to attain. Hamd said that around NIS 50m passes into the Gaza Strip every month or so. The Bank of Palestine told the Bulletin that an individual can bring up to $10,000 cash into Gaza. However, since only a handful of businessmen are able to travel in and out of Gaza, this does not amount to much. According to the Bank of Palestine and Arab Bank, there are no pre-set daily limits for withdrawals. Private and public sector salaries in Gaza are paid in Israeli shekels (NIS), (about two thirds of the total employed in Gaza), while UNRWA and foreign institutions pay salaries in US$. Jordanian Dinars (JD) are also used but to a lesser extent. However this month US$ and JD are in greater demand than NIS. Hamd suggested this may be largely related to UNRWA, which brings in and distributes most of the US$ in Gaza, through employee salaries, cash assistance for its job creation programme and the remaining damage costs for refugees affected by the recent hostilities. This month UNWRA has not brought as many dollars into Gaza as it has done in the past. Shokri Karaz, Branch Manager of Arab Bank in Gaza, told the Bulletin that the lack of dollars and JD in Gaza™s banks is greatly impacting spending patterns, affecting building projects and wedding plans alike. Karaz explained that when cash is available, customers tend to take out as much future of the banks.The almost total closure of Gaza™s borders and the liquidity crisis are affecting exchange rates. Traders are increasingly using currency with capital, are depositing Israeli shekels into dollar bank accounts to get a better exchange rate for the shekel.

This includes the expansion of Israeli settlements and outposts in the West Bank, developing infrastructure to connect the settlements to Israel, restrictions on Palestinian construction and demolitions in Area C under Israeli military control.5 The move under discussion would deepen the existing reality on the ground and provide a legal framework for it, making it ﬁde jure annexationﬂ.6economically viable Palestinian State.

This includes the entire Jordan valley (except for an enclave around Jericho) and the Dead Sea in the eastern part of the West Bank, land located between the Israeli Separation Wall and the Green Line (armistice line of 1949), and the Jewish enclaves in the corridors area between east and west of the West Bank.Under the terms of the plan Israel could annex around 1,812 km2 (32%) of the West Bank land area (5,661 km2), while sixteen Israeli settlements with 15,675 settlers 1 https://wapo.st/3fx1rRT 2 https://bit.ly/2Buqm9W 3 https://bit.ly/2ULL3oj 4 https://bit.ly/3hv4ls1 5 https://indd.adobe.com/view/acfbc290-e96b-44f9-8617-58052a785c686 https://bit.ly/2N2401P 7 https://bit.ly/2UHpdCw 8 www.whitehouse.gov/peacetoprosperity/Following the announcement, Hussein al-Sheikh, head of the Palestinian Civil Affairs Authority, stated that the PNA refused to accept the transfer of May clearance revenues from Israel, as it is absolved of all agreements and understandings with the Government of Israel.34  The clearance revenues account for approximately $208m per month and over 60% of tax revenues.35 As a result, the PNA has been unable to pay salaries from May 2020.36 The PNA has begun implementing budget cuts that include cutting salaries of tens of thousands contributes towards salaries, medical expenses, and utility fees.37 By the end of June, there was still no word as to whether the Government would be able to cover public sector salaries for May, which usually are paid in On 9 June, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh announced that the PNA had submitted a Quartet38, that provides for the creation of a sovereign, independent, and demilitarised Palestinian state, along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as the capital. He suggestions to resume contact in order to transfer clearance revenues, noting that Israel could transfer the funds without direct contact.39The PNA also expressed its stance to international donor partners through a statement to the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC). The statement stated that annexation would violate Palestinians™ basic rights, deprive them of sovereignty over their natural resources, undermine the territorial unity of the Palestinian territories, and cause detriment to the two-state solution. The PNA called upon all States to recognise the State of Palestine with pre-1967 borders, adopt measures of accountability (such as sanctions), and work towards ending the Israeli occupation of areas occupied since 1967.40On 21 June, Hussein al-Sheikh told Israel™s public radio Kan that the PNA and Palestinian security forces will collapse if Israel proceeds with its annexation plan.4134 http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=37R4Uca117299750238a37R4Uc35 https://wapo.st/2YALva4 36 https://bit.ly/30VFIPv 37 https://nyti.ms/311GWsz 38 consists of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia, with a mandate to assist in mediating Middle East peace negotiations while supporting Palestinian economic development and institution building39 https://bit.ly/2CaNLxt 40 www.lacs.ps/documentsShow.aspx?ATT_ID=4526441 www.al-ayyam.ps/ar_page.php?id=13f99938y335124792Y13f99938  International ResponseInternational responses to potential annexation have been largely critical, with most nations and organisations denouncing the decision and urging that it be reconsidered.

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 108September 2015Economic Assessments The Government of Palestine1 and the IMF2 issued reports assessing the current state of and prospects for the Palestinian economy. According to the IMF, the economic outlook for the West Bank and Gaza for the remainder of 2015 is challenging and subject to considerable risks. Assuming there is no change in restrictions and/or security conditions, the IMF projects growth in the West Bank to slow to 1.8% by year end, from 5% in 2014. According to the IMF, the expected drop reßects the impact of increased uncertainty on private demand and reduced growth in Israel. In Gaza, a rebound of 6.5% is expected, assuming continued reconstruction activity. Real GDP growth for the Palestinian economy is therefore projected at 2.9%, implying stagnant per capita GDP given the high rate of population growth. Inßation is projected to remain low, at less than 2%. The main risks to the outlook relate to heightened political and security tensions and a related lower than expected rebound in private investment and Þscal slippages. The latter include revenue shortfalls, lower donor aid, and the inability of the PNA to withstand spending pressures.The IMF estimates that in the medium term, absent a political breakthrough, growth will remain below what is needed to durably reduce unemployment and improve living standards (Figure 1). Under a baseline scenario assuming political status quo and unchanged Israeli restrictions, some decline in aid after the completion of Gaza reconstruction, and limited policy actions on the part of the PNA, growth is expected to hover around 3%, with a rise in unemployment. A further deterioration in the political landscape or aid shortfalls would produce even worse economic outcomes. On the other hand, the IMF points out that even in the absence of a political breakthrough, improvements in Israeli-Palestinian economic cooperation could prove beneÞcial.Figure 1: GDP growth and projections (2012 - 2020)-15-10-5051015West BankGaza StripPalestine201220132014201520162017201820192020Source: IMF1 www.ldf.ps/documentsShow.aspx?ATT_ID=219792 www.imf.org/external/country/WBG/RR/2015/092115.pdfIn September, the new Palestinian city of Rawabi welcomed its Þrst residents, 2,000 people are expected to live there by the end of yearBetween 14 and 16 September, Þve leading Palestinian companies from the stone and marble sector participated at ‚The Big 5 Kuwait™, the country™s largest international construction eventThe Current Account deÞcit (totaling $372.7m in Q2 2015) increased by 15.2% compared to the previous quarterA recent report by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development suggests that that Gaza ﬁcould become uninhabitable by 2020 due to ongoing de-development, eight years of economic blockade and three military operations in the past six yearsﬂThe Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

Two decades of instability have resulted in a pattern of declining GDP per capita, high unemployment and continued deterioration of Gaza™s historically strong productive sectors. The energies of government and business must be directed towards sustainable development, with the private sector at its heart. Creating a longer-term vision for a stable, connected and thriving Gaza can help guide shorter-term interventions.

The decrease was mainly driven by a loss of 20,500 jobs in Gaza and 11,200 jobs in Israel and Israeli settlements during the same period. The labour force participation rate for Palestine remained relatively unchanged in Q2 2017 (45.4%) when compared to Q1 2017 (45.8%) and Q2 2016 (45.7%). The major difference between the female participation rate (particularly low at 18.5%) and the male participation rate (71.6%) persisted. The wide gap in unemployment by gender also remained, as female unemployment reached 50%, compared to 23.7% for males. The situation was more pronounced in Gaza, where female unemployment amounted to 71.5%, compared to 36.2% for males. In the West Bank, the unemployment rate for females was 36.2%, compared to 16.8% for males.Another persistent trend is youth unemployment, with 46.3% of those aged 20-24 years and 39.2% of those aged 25-29 years unemployed in Q2 2017. Among female youth, the unemployment rate reached 72.7% for those aged 20-24 years and 69.1% for those aged 25-29 years. The most educated Palestinian women (13+ years of schooling) also face a high unemployment rate at 57.4%, despite exhibiting a relatively high labour force participation rate (46.7%). This is a particularly worrisome trend as it could discourage women from pursuing higher education.1 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_7-8-2017-LF-en.pdf  The Palestine Monetary Authority Business Cycle Index (PMABCI) deteriorated to -4.3 points in August 2017, from 0.3 points in the previous monthAccording to data recently released by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in goods reached $1,034m in Q2 2017, an increase of 1.6% from Q1 2017The Palestine Investment Fund (PIF) announced on 30 August 2017, the commencement of the construction of the Al-Nuaima Solar Power Station in the Jericho and Jordan Valley GovernorateAppMahal, a Palestinian mobile application developer, completed a $4m Series B Fund Management Company The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

This tension has been compounded by the lack of agreed communication channels on economic issues between the two sides. Under the Paris Economic Protocol signed in 1994, a Palestinian-Israeli Joint Economic Committee (JEC) was established to follow up the implementation of the agreement and to arbitrate issues related to the economy.2 However, the Committee has been inactive since the early 2000s despite some attempts to reactivate it.3 The recent partial resolution of the 2019 clearance revenue dispute between the PNA and Israel was supposed to include the reconvening of some technical committees within the JEC framework and a reconsideration of the Paris Protocol, but no progress has since been announced on these issues.Halting Import of Calves from IsraelOn 28 October, Riyad Atari, the Palestinian Minister of Agriculture, announced that the Israeli authorities had approved the import of 10,700 calves to Palestine from abroad, through Palestinian traders. He stated that 1,680 calves will be imported in the next few days, and the remainder gradually introduced into the market in batches until mid-November.4Palestine imports around 120,000 calves from Israel annually; 20,000 from Israeli farms, and 100,000 from Israeli traders importing from abroad.5 On 16 September, Atari announced the Government™s plan to halt all calf imports from Israel or from Israeli importers, and he called upon all regulatory bodies to follow up on implementation.6 The Government™s announcement came as part of its wider economic disengagement policy, whereby Palestinians would be able to import calves directly from abroad through Palestinian traders rather than through Israeli importers or from Israeli farms.However, the GoI has meanwhile threatened to halt the entry of Palestinian agricultural products (approximately 280-300 tons per day) into the Israeli market if a ﬁboycottﬂ of livestock imports from Israel is pursued.7 The Palestinian Government has since sources of imports.8 Palestinian traders have informed the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture that the Gol and the Israeli veterinary department have held up clearance health standards, which will result in a 25-day delay to complete necessary health checks.9 The GoI also rescinded Businessman Cards (BMCs)10 of Palestinian direct 1 http://palestinecabinet.gov.ps/Website/AR/ViewDetails?ID=437252 www.paltrade.org/upload/agreements/Paris%20Economic%20Protocol.pdf3 https://bit.ly/2rVbpZy 4 www.alhadath.ps/article/108478/5 www.alhadath.ps/article/108478/ 6 www.palestineeconomy.ps/ar/Article/154827 www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-israel-palestinian-authority-economy-boycott-1.79912568 https://bit.ly/32gFgIC9 quarantine is usually 8 days; https://bit.ly/35i7lRD 10 A magnetic permit that allows a limited number of Palestinian business executives to move between the Palestinian Territories and Israel.

      "The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 120September 2016World Bank and IMF Reports to the AHLCPolitical and security uncertainties limit the prospects for economic growth in Palestine in 2016, according to recent reports by the World Bank and the IMF to the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC).1 According to the documents, the Palestinian economic outlook is worrying in the context of a stalled peace process. The two institutions project medium-term growth in real GDP income given the projected population growth. Once again, the World Bank and the IMF stressed the need for revived efforts by all relevant parties (the Palestinian National Authority Œ PNA, the Government of Israel Œ GoI and international donors) to reduce the pressure on the PNA™s budget, to support the reconstruction of Gaza and to renew the peace process.According to the World Bank, ﬁPolitical instability and the long lasting restrictions on movement, access and trade are the main impediments to economic growthﬂ in resulted in the ﬁdeindustrializationﬂ of the Palestinian economy - with the share of manufacturing in GDP dropping from 18% in 1995 to around 10% in 2015. The share of agriculture in the economy has also decreased to 50% of what it was in 1995. The World Bank also states that whilst the Palestinian economy will not be able to reach its potential until a permanent peace agreement has been established, there is much that can be done. One of the key constraints to economic growth continues to be Israeli restrictions on Palestinian access to Area C.  A 2014 World Bank study suggested that unrestricted Palestinian economic activity in Area C, including the exploitation of its natural resources, could increase GDP by as much as 35% and create thousands of jobs, primarily through growth in the agricultural sector and Dead Sea minerals processing industries.2 The importance of Area C for economic development was emphasized by the members of the AHLC during a recent meeting in New York. The AHLC also stressed that further reforms by the Palestinian Government are required to improve the economic conditions, with particular attention to competitiveness and the business climate.According to the World Bank, reforms to improve the business climate could also help support the Palestinian economy, with efforts needed on four priority areas. First, there is a need to reform the current legislation governing business, as it currently is a mixture of Ottoman, British Mandate, Jordanian, Egyptian and Palestinian laws, in addition to Israeli Military Orders. This has created many internal inconsistencies in the rules governing business activity in Palestine. Adoption by the PNA of pending legislation, including the Competition Law and the 1 http://bit.ly/2d9BWHM and http://bit.ly/2deWuix2 http://bit.ly/2d9D8upOn 13 September, the PNA and the GoI signed an agreement to resolve the payment of the accumulated debt of the PNA to the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) and to restructure the relation between the GoI and the PNA with respect to electricity provision and consumptionOn 31 August, under the auspices of Prime Minister Dr. Rami Hamdallah, the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) held its Economic Conference 2016 under the theme ﬁTowards a New Vision for the Revival of the Palestinian EconomyﬂThe Government has maintained a stable level of current expenditure by decreasing its expenditure on employees™ compensation, according to the recently published Financial Statement for General GovernmentPEX announced that the listed companies increased by reaching $163m compared to $139m during the same period in 2015The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust. Please send any comments, suggestions, or complaints to feedback@portlandtrust.org© 2016 The Portland Trust Printed for The Portland Trust in Ramallah by Al Nasher Advertising and PRThe gross expenditure of the general government reached $4,430m in 2015, an increase of 3.3% from 2014. The Statement indicates that the increase has been mainly assets (especially by local government). The Government has managed to maintain a stable level of current expenditure by decreasing its expenditure on employees™ compensation (around a 9% drop in absolute terms between 2014 and 2015). This decrease could be attributed to the PNA™s active effort to stabilize the wage bill. Despite an increase in revenue received from taxation, (mainly aid to the central government) resulted in general government revenue falling by 7.5% from 2014 to $4,110m in 2015. PCBS data on taxation between 2010 and 2015 shows that the absolute value of collected taxes increased collection by central government. As a result of the decrease in revenues from 2014 and the lack of substantial change in current expenses, the net operating balance (revenues minus current expenses) of the general government dropped from $342m in 2014 to only $12m in 2015. half of 2016 (available in the latest World Bank report to the AHLC) suggests that while the PNA could align its spending and revenue capacity in the medium to long term, in the short term there remains an urgent need for projected for 2016.August TradingIn August, the Al-Quds index decreased by 0.72% from the previous month, reaching 507.8 points on the last day of trading.5 A total of 29.8m shares worth $49.4m were traded during the month, marking an increase from July 2016 of 105% and 82.4% in the number and value of traded shares, respectively. Market capitalization reached $3.25bn.5 www.pex.ps/psewebsite/publications/PEXIssue77_August2016.pdfIn related news, PEX announced that the aggregated net half of 2016, reaching $163m compared to $139m during the same period in 2015.6 The majority of listed companies eight companies which recorded a loss, totaling $3m. followed by Bank of Palestine (BOP) ($24.4m; +7.3%) and PADICO Holding ($13.5m; -11%).7PEX also announced that the cash and stock dividends distributed in 2015 by listed companies amounted to $180m, a growth of 5% compared to 2014.8 Cash dividends were $155m and stock dividends were $25.2m.

Alongside the numerous human losses and injuries being suffered during the operation, governmental and international organisations working in Gaza have reported considerable damage to infrastructure and economic loss. The destruction of power, water, health, education and other service facilities poses severe challenges to the already vulnerable economy of Gaza. of up to 40% of its total needs.1announced they were no longer able to guarantee the provision of electricity for even 8 hours a day.2 At the time of going to print, electricity blackouts around Gaza were reported to have reached up to 12 hours per day on average.3 In central Gaza and Khan Younis, reports indicated that cuts lasting approximately 15 hours per day were affecting around 400,000 people. The situation had become more severe following damage to six out of the ten high tension power lines running from Israel into Gaza. As reported by Gisha, this left hundreds of thousands of people completely without power, while hundreds of thousands more were merely receiving between 2-5 hours of electricity per day.4The water supply situation was reported to be equally critical. According to OCHA, damage to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities resulted in much lower than normal levels of water being supplied to the population.5 As the Bulletin went to print, it was estimated that 1.2 million people had very limited or no access to water or sanitation services due to damage to the electricity system or lack of fuel to run generators to power WASH facilities. At the same time, several areas were General economic activity was reported to have been virtually paralysed since the beginning of the operation, as most businesses remained closed. At the time of going to press, activity in the crossings in and out of Gaza was reported to be largely limited to the passage of humanitarian aid, emergency assistance goods (including fuel and food), medical evacuations and other exceptional cases. At herders were in need of animal feed for their livestock, and severe damage to agricultural holdings had been reported - including the partial or total destruction of 58 dunums of green houses and 1,230 dunums of orchards and vegetables. As farmers were unable to access their land, around 2,000 cultivated dunums of irrigated vegetables were at risk of drought and loss.6As hospitals began to run out of essential medicine stocks and more displaced families seek shelter in UNRWA facilities, the UN organisation launched a $60m emergency appeal to continue its activities in response to the humanitarian crisis during the coming months.71 www.palthink.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Policy-Paper-Electricity-Crisis-in-Gaza.pdf2 www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=7088973 www.gisha.org/updates/30184 www.gisha.org/updates/30855 www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_sitrep_22_07_2014.pdf6 www.bit.ly/1lz6PAM and www.bit.ly/1lz70w87The IMF published a report assessing recent macroeconomic developments in Palestine and providing forecastsIn Q1 2014 Palestinian quarterly GDP decreased by 0.6% in real terms with respect to the previous quarterIn Q1 2014 the current $418.5m, increasing by 14.6% with respect to the previous quarter and by more than 70% from Q1 2013Preliminary results of the 2013 annual food security survey show that 33% of Palestinian households are food insecure The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

The challenging conditions derived from the long term restrictions imposed on Gaza by the government of Israel have led to structural economic stagnation and a continuous deterioration of the living standards. As reported by UNRWA, the number of Palestinian refugees relying on food aid has increased from less than 80,000 in 2000 to over 830,000 today. The grave humanitarian consequences following the recent escalation in Gaza are likely to further deteriorate food security standards and have long-lasting impact on its population.  EntrepreneurshipThe fourth Startup Weekend Gaza (SWG) took place on 19-21 June.15 Despite the relatively small start-up scene in Gaza, 150 companies were selected to participate in the hands-on web and mobile technology event from among 650 applicants, marking the largest-to-date event of its kind in Gaza.16 As such, SWG demonstrates the existence of a young, vibrant community committed to working for a better living through innovation and creative thinking.  In Gaza, women and youth are taking the lead in the entrepreneurship scene. This phenomenon could result in tangible improvements for such marginalised population segments if conditions for the sustainable development of the sector are promoted. More than half of SWG participants were female and the youngest participants were 14 and 16 years old. 15 www.gaza.startupweekend.org/16 www.wamda.com/2014/06/startup-weekend-gaza-4-turning-point-ecosystem'),\n",

Formed of independent technocrats, the new government is tasked with the mission of preparing for national elections (intended to be held within the next six months) and integrating West Bank and Gaza institutions, following seven years of internal political division. Four of the newly appointed government ministers are residents from Gaza. Dr Rami Hamdallah, an academic and university president, was re-appointed as Prime Minister of the new technocratic government, after having served as the Prime Minister of the PNA since June 2013. Of the 16 ministers under him about half were members of the previous PNA government, including Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, Dr Mohammad Mustafa, who has also been appointed as the new government´s Minister of National Economy. Dr Mustafa is also currently the Chairman of the Palestine Investment Fund (PIF), which he joined as CEO in 2005. Shukri Bishara, who has served as the PNA Minister of Finance since mid-2013, will be responsible for both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning under the new government. With extensive private sector experience, Mr Bishara served as CEO of the Housing Bank for Trade & Finance, and held several positions at the Arab Bank between 1979 and 2006, when he was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of the PIF.School to Work TransitionThe Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics announced the main results of the Youth Transition from School to Work Survey 2013, conducted in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO). The survey, part of ILO™s Work4Youth Project, was carried out in 28 countries around the world.Findings indicate that the majority of Palestinian youth struggle to successfully which the ILO argues is one of the main causes of long-term unemployment.1Survey results show that in 2013 only 23% of young Palestinians completed their transition from education to stable or satisfactory employment. At the same time, nearly half of young graduates had not started their transition, and around 32% remained ﬁin transitionﬂ. The education-to-employment transitional period was stable job after the completion of studies. The survey also suggests that the opportunities available in the Palestinian labour market require relatively low skill levels. Consequently, better educated data shows that the highest youth unemployment rates were registered among (75.4% in total Œ 67.1% among males and 83.5% among females).1 www.bit.ly/UTCff5The results of the Youth Transition from School to Work Survey indicate that the majority of Palestinian youth struggle to successfully move from education to employmentIn mid-May the Bank of Israel banned Palestinian commercial banks from making deposits of shekels in Israeli banksThe US Senate approved a $48.3bn State and Foreign Operations bill that included cuts in total aid funding to PalestineThe IFC announced an investment of up to $3m in the Palestine Growth Capital Fund, a Palestinian private equity fundForum discussed the challenges facing the water sector, focusing on the water and energy nexus and the role of the private sectorThe Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

As the Bulletin went to print, Gisha reported that Israel had ordered further restrictions on movement at Gaza™s crossings.18 There is an urgent need to enable major construction projects in Gaza, as the sector contributes roughly a quarter of Gaza™s GDP and remains an important source of employment for Gazan workers. The recent sharp rise in total unemployment in Gaza (which reached 41% in Q1 2014, up from 31% in Q1 2013) was largely driven by a loss of around 12,500 jobs in the construction sector. As a result, construction™s share of total employment in Gaza decreased from 6.9% in Q1 2013 to 2.2% in Q1 2014.19May PEX TradingDuring most of May the Al-Quds index continued its downward trend, although it partially recovered towards the end of the month.

Of the total, only 42 licenses (0.02%) were issued for construction in Gaza.Construction activities in Gaza remain severely affected by the long-standing restrictions on the entrance of construction materials from Israel and Egypt. The closure of most trade tunnels between Gaza and Egypt between 2012 and 2013 left the Karm Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing, connecting Gaza to Israel, as the main passage for the transfer of goods into and out of the Strip. Since the last quarter of 2013 restrictions on the entrance of several construction projects have been frozen as a result of the shortage. There are currently only 81 active projects in Gaza, all of them funded either by Qatar or international organisations (in addition to 27 UNRWA projects).16June 2014 Israel permitted the entrance of construction materials for a number of projects implemented by the UN, after having banned the passage of all construction materials, whether for international organisations or the private sector, from October 2013.17 As of 16 June other construction materials were reported to be entering in 15 www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_PCBS/Downloads/book2054.pdf16 www.gisha.org/en-blog/2014/06/12/building-in-ruins/17 www.gisha.org/UserFiles/File/publications/Info_Gaza_Eng.pdf'),\n",

Of the total traded from Gaza in May, 61 truckloads were exports to Israel (39) and other international markets (22), while the rest was marketed in the West Bank.1 The increase comes as a result of some relaxation on restrictions to the exit of goods from Gaza by the Government of Israel (GoI), which since November 2014 has allowed the sale of certain Gaza-made products in the West Bank. More recently, from March 2015, the GoI has allowed the entry of agricultural products from Gaza into Israel, following a complete ban since 2007. Between 8 March and 11 June (latest available data), 102 truckloads of tomatoes and eggplants (equalling almost 1,400 tons) were exported from Gaza to Israel.2While increased trade from Gaza is undoubtedly a positive development, recent allowed out of Gaza is only a negligible portion of the trade level observed prior to the blockade.    Data from UNOCHA (Figure 1) shows that exports from Gaza dropped from 15,255 truckloads in 2000 to as little as 136 truckloads in 2014.3 A sharp decrease was immediately observed after the beginning of the blockade, with merely 33 truckloads of goods leaving Gaza in 2008. Average monthly exports in 2014 (11.3 truckloads) amounted to just 0.9% of the monthly average in 2000. Even if the upward trend observed over the last few months is sustained during the rest of 2015, the average number of monthly truckloads is unlikely to exceed 3% of the 2000 level.Figure 1: Exports from Gaza, 2000-2015* (Truckloads)2000    2001    2002    2003    2004   2005   2006   2007    2008   2009    2010    2011    2012   2013   2014   2015*9,6799,4089,3195,2905,18333422152682541821361357,86915,25515,1370200040006000800010000120001400016000Source: OCHA OPT(*) Data for 2015 only covers January-May (latest available)1 www.gisha.org/graph/2401?datares=monthly2 www.bit.ly/1TEpnTX // Sales were enabled by the GoI during the current Jewish ﬁshmitaﬂ year only (a special period in a seven-year cycle during which land owned by religious Jews in Israel cannot be exploited)3 www.bit.ly/1IVVAA3 // Exports data only includes truckloads leaving Gaza with destination Israel or other international markets (i.e. does not include Gaza-produced goods marketed in the West Bank) The RAND Corporation presented a report aimed at estimating the costs of the Israeli-Palestinian study builds on detailed analysis to calculate the Palestinians and Israelis of ranging from a two-state solution to a situation of violent uprisingRecent analysis by the IMF focuses on Palestine™s recommendations to enhance tax collection and deriving GDP growth with the PNA Ministry of National Economy and launched a new National Export Strategy for 2014-2018ﬁInternational Green Environment & Energy Expo & Forumﬂ took place in Ramallah between 2-4 JuneThe Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

More than 20 exhibitors raised awareness around the importance of preserving the environment, promoting greater energy independence in Palestine, and rationalizing consumption. Dr. Omar Kitaneh, chairman of the PNA Energy and Natural Resources Authority, addressed the conference, stressing the strategic importance of renewable energy for Palestine™s development and the government™s commitment to enabling investment in the sector. With over 60 companies working on renewable energy, 40 of which are organised under the Palestinian Federation of Renewable Energy Industries, the sector is gaining momentum. Following long-standing blocks to the development of projects due to regulatory gaps, it is expected that the Cabinet approval of a draft Renewable Energy Law in May 2015 will unlock investment and job creation opportunities. 11 www.facebook.com/IGEE.Expo?fref=photo'),\n",

The West Bank´s GDP increased by almost 2% from Q1 2014, although this was mainly motivated by rises in the net collection of VAT on imports (23%) and custom duties (27%). Enhanced tax collection partly compensated real drops in the value added by important economic activities, including construction (-8%) and manufacturing (-10%). Poor economic performance in the West Bank during Q1 2015 is likely to be related to decreased consumption due to the inability of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to pay public workers´ salaries in full during January and February, after the Government of Israel (GoI) temporarily suspended the transfer of clearance revenues.Most economic sectors contracted at the country level in Q1 2015 with respect to the previous year (Table 1).

This, according to PIBF, could boost GDP from $12bn to $44bn in ten years. PIBF™s research estimates that the FTA would enable double-digit growth The research suggests that export-driven growth could be centred on high potential economic sectors, most notably the manufacturing industry, agriculture and tourism (all of which have experienced poor growth under the status quo). Opportunities for these and other sectors are deemed greater in the Pan-Arab market, which is expected to become the main destination for Palestinian exports, alongside Israel.Korean Support for Tech Start-upsIn June the Korea International Cooperation Agency signed agreements with the PNA Ministry of Planning and Administrative Development and the PNA Ministry of Telecommunication and Information Technology to support Palestinian IT start-ups with $7m in grants, to be disbursed under the Palestine Start-Up Support (PASS) programme.11 The PASS aims to activate the start-up ecosystem in both the West Bank and Gaza by improving the investment environment, intensifying an acceleration programme and fostering greater collaboration between universities and the business sector.

The saving will depend on the price that customers were paying previously.the cost of these reforms. This will gradually be withdrawn over four years to incentivise improved performance from the electricity companies, including increasing the rate of payment collection which has historically been low. The price reduction will help bring down the proportion of household income spent on electricity which, at 10%, is one of the highest in the region.2The scheme categorises households based on their monthly consumption: below 100 kWh, 101-200 kWh, and above 200 kWh. Households with a lower monthly consumption, typically poorer households, will pay lower prices per kWh. The price of electricity with regular or prepaid meters will be the same per kWh, but regular meters will require a monthly subscription of NIS 10. The price of electricity for commercial purposes (retail businesses for example) will decline by 2-22%.  Industrial enterprises will pay 22-36% less, the price of electricity used in agriculture will drop by 27-37% and in water pumping by 20-24%.The new system will treat the Jordan River Valley region in a special manner to emphasise the importance of the area in agrarian and industrial development. Households and industries in the valley will pay NIS 0.05-0.20 less per kWh than in other areas, which will mean a price reduction of nearly 40% for the region.The most recent energy survey, released in June by the Palestinian Central Bureau for Statistics (PCBS), shows that nearly all Palestinian households (99.8%) are now connected to the public electricity network.3 Between January 2010 and January 2011, average household consumption of electricity grew by 4.72%, reaching 266 kWh in the current year. While both normal (57.7%) and prepaid (42.3%) meters are widely used within the West Bank, prepaid meters remain unavailable in the Gaza Strip.1 See: http://www.maannews.net/arb/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=398242&MARK=%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%A92 See: July 2010 Bulletin Economic Feature3 See: http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/HouseHoldEN012011E.pdfThe London Stock Exchange hosted the second Palestinian Capital Markets Day in June.

In 2012 around 10% of the Palestinian population aged 18-64 had been involved in starting or running a business at some stage during the previous 42 months. Overall, as many as 273,000 entrepreneurs were active in Palestine in 2012. In this same year, entrepreneurship activity rates in other MENA economies such as Egypt and Algeria were of 8.8% and 7.8%, respectively. Despite high entrepreneurial activity rates (and in line with global trends2), a major gender gap exists among entrepreneurs in Palestine. In 2012 the early-stage entrepreneurship rate for males in the West Bank was 16%, four times the 4% ratio registered among women. This represents a widening of the gender gap observed in 2010, when 18% of men and 10% of women were considered to be entrepreneurs. In Gaza, the entrepreneurship gender gap increased from about 5% in 2010 (when the male rate was around 6% and that of females was below 1%) to nearly 14% in 2012 (when the male rate rose to 16% and the female ratio reached 2%).While the middle-aged population (25-44) is typically the most likely to participate in entrepreneurial activities, their engagement has decreased over the last 3 years. At the same time, the participation of the youngest adult population segment (18-24) increased. This trend is regarded by MAS as a very positive development since youth entrepreneurship is considered to be one of the main driving forces of any economy: young entrepreneurs contribute enthusiasm, motivation and innovation. The report also shows that the average Palestinian entrepreneur is well-educated, as there is a high positive correlation between entrepreneurial activity rates and Palestine was prepared), early-stage entrepreneurship has become slightly more equally distributed among individuals with different educational levels. Income levels also appear to be among the main determinants of entrepreneurship. Individuals with higher household income are more likely to start entrepreneurial are motivated by opportunity (58%) rather than by necessity (42%).Finally, the report also shows that entrepreneurship also plays a crucial role in terms of employment generation. As estimated by MAS, in 2012 762,900 jobs were directly related to the development of entrepreneurial activities, accounting for as much as 77% of the Palestinian labour force. More than 273,000 of those employed were entrepreneurs themselves (owners and managers of small companies) and 1 www.mas.ps/2012/Publications2 www.gemconsortium.org/docs/download/2645In Q1 2013 Palestinian real GDP decreased by 5.1% with respect to the previous quarter and was 2.7% higher than in Q1 2012.During July the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry launched the Palestine Business Council for Dubai and Northern Emirates.On 26 June the PA Ministry of National Economy and the Union of Palestinian Chambers of Commerce Chamber Information System.™The Palestinian Monetary Authority Business Cycle Indicator experienced a major drop in June.In June 2013 the overall consumer price index slightly increased with respect to the previous month.The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

The rise in unemployment in Gaza was mostly driven by an absolute loss of around 12,500 jobs in the construction sector, greatly affected by the destruction of trading tunnels with Egypt and the long-standing restrictions on imports of construction materials from Israel. As a result, construction™s share of total employment in Gaza decreased from 6.9% in Q1 2013 to 2.2% in Q1 2014. At the same time, in the West Bank more than 29,000 jobs were added in commerce, hotels and restaurants, and around 20,000 new positions were created in construction activities between Q1 2013 and Q1 2014.Total unemployment in Q1 2014 was higher among women (36.5%) than among male workers (23.3%). The increase in total unemployment was partly explained by a rise in total labour force participation (LFP). As more workers entered the labour market, LFP reached 46.3% in Q1 2014, up from 43.4% in Q1 2013. LFP increased the most among Gazan women on a year-to-year basis (+5.1 percentage points), making female LFP in Gaza (20.5%) higher than in the West Bank (19.8%). However, female LFP continues to be low at an aggregate level, reaching 17.3% (against 69.3% among men). This is a common feature of several countries in the region, as LFP rates among Syrian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Lebanese women are equally low (ranging between 13-24%). Cultural reasons seem to be the main underlying factor keeping women out of the labour market, as almost 70% of Palestinian women who were not looking for a job in 2013 carried out housework. Annual data for 2013 shows that total unemployment, at 23.4%, reached its highest level since 2010. Following a long-term trend, the total unemployment rate was much higher in Gaza (32.6%) than in the West Bank (18.6%).

This is a market we should encourage, since they are mainly coming to our side. What about the quality of tourism services? Do you see a Most hotels have historically been training their own employees. They bring workers from anywhere and simply get them to work. That is already done, but we should not continue on that basis. This is why our current project to create a hospitality school in Jericho is so important, as it will allow us to improve the quality of the offerings and professionalise services. We see that people are willing to stay in Palestine, but they obviously expect a professional service.Can you tell us more about the school project? It is a joint venture between the hotel association and the tour operator association, which I preside. It is purely will include the PA Ministry of Education and Ministry the curricula, for graduates to be acknowledged and have priority when looking for a job. Seed money for the investment came from American donors and we are now hoping that the Japanese will engage as well. Although we expect to raise around 60% of total investment from donor funding, the school will operate as a hotel too, since we need to ensure the commercial sustainability of the project. We should not depend on donations for the rest of our lives, but survive and stand on our own. I am very optimistic about the future of tourism in Palestine, even without peace. Of course that if we had peace it would be the best thing that ever happened to us. But even under the conditions in which we are living now we see a modest (although continuous) increase in the level of activity. Tourism is the only industry that is really viable as far as I am concerned; it is our petroleum, and something we have to protect. I believe that in the mid to long term it could constitute up to 30% of GDP.making a mistake is that they are competing with each other rather than working to improve income per hotel. Whenever tourists are visiting the Holy Land, Israel and Palestine, we need to make programmes in which they stay overnight in Jericho, Bethlehem and East Jerusalem. But it is not the quantity that we are after at the end of the day, but the quality. We are limited in the numbers of visitors we can absorb: how many people can visit the Church of the Nativity? How many people can walk in the Old City of Jerusalem? We have to be careful. It is not a mass production industry. The focus should be on providing a better service and getting a higher income for that. We need to develop ´boutique´ or ´niche´ tourism for the time being. What particular tourist segments are you thinking about for the development of niche tourism?Now our business is basically depending on religious tourists. This has been good, and we should protect it. However, to increase our numbers dramatically, we should go into cultural trips and approach large companies in markets with high potential. Another sector that could be important for us is the Diaspora. And to attract them we have to create events. We are happy to see that the Ramallah Club from North America will be having their annual meeting in Ramallah this summer. Another particularly promising market for Diaspora tourists is in South America, where there are many Palestinians from Bethlehem, Beit Sahour and Beit Jala. pilgrimage destinations, such as Lourdes in France or Fatima in Portugal? It is! And that is really a shame! I think that the detrimental part is related to the political issue. And we are talking about just one segment here, the Christians, but how about the Muslims coming to Palestine? If tourists from the Arab world were allowed to come into Israel they would swamp the place. It is the third holiest site for Islam. Muslim pilgrimage is not complete without coming to Jerusalem. Of course for political reasons Israel is not opening the door for this market. However, there are '),\n",

Both reports focus on the slowdown in economic activity, observed during 2012. Real GDP growth reached 5.9% last year, down from an average rate of almost 11% in 2010-2011.3 The World Bank attributes the slowdown to the absence of easing In particular, the organisation stresses that the continuation of restrictions and the absence of real opportunities to open up the Palestinian economy are major obstacles to allow private sector-led growth.High and persistent unemployment (especially among youth) continues to pose a major challenge to the Palestinian Economy, characterised by low labour force participation rates, high unemployment duration and the concentration of workers Bank these factors prevent many Palestinians of working age from developing on-the-job skills, which are much needed to enhance local competitiveness in the global economy.As a result of the current situation, the IMF™s growth forecasts (shown in table 1 below) have deteriorated with respect to their September 2012 assessment.

On 19 November, over 200 people attended the ‚Towards a Green Future™ conference which was sponsored by the Italian Government, the PA and UN agencies. Attendees acknowledged green energy and the environment as critical factors for Palestinian economic growth and development. A ‚Joint Declaration™ between Italy and the PA was formalised at the conference and a ‚Technical Steering Committee™ was established to enhance cooperation and development of eco-sustainable activities and projects.1While this is a relatively new area of focus for the Palestinian economy there are a few green projects already underway. In Hebron, a wind turbine will supply 700kw of energy to the Al-Ahli Hospital, covering approximately 40% of its total requirements. Energy costs of the hospital, which is the largest in the West Bank, will be reduced by 30-40% as a result. The EU has contributed •1.3m towards the three-year project, which was launched at the end of September 2009.2Rawabi, the planned new city outside Ramallah, has been designed to be green spaces throughout the commercial and residential areas and special attention has been given to the transport system to reduce the use of cars. Water re-use, waste water treatment, energy preservation techniques, rain harvesting and recycling strategies have all been taken into consideration during the design phase. A tree-planting initiative, ﬁGROW for a Greener Palestineﬂ, has commenced on the site. 25,000 new trees will be planted and a further 5,000 relocated during construction. Individuals are able to purchase trees through the Rawabi website.3It is expected that there will be an increase in the number of green initiatives in the Palestinian Territory next year. With 3,000 sunshine hours per year there is high potential from solar power. Many Palestinians already take a sustainable approach to energy Œ 68% of households use solar water heating systems.4 Abdullah Shra™rawi, Business Development Manager at PADICO, stressed the economic viability of green energy, stating that PADICO considers investment in this sector as ‚low risk with long term capital growth™ and plans to expand its investment into the green energy sector in the next 3 years. Ilaria Debonis, from the Consulate General of Italy, told the Bulletin that the Italian government are currently considering a new project related to ‚green schools™ with the assistance of Italian architects.1 See: http://www.agriregionieuropa.univpm.it/materiale/2009/Final_Agenda.pdf 2 See: http://www.awep.ps/3 See: http://www.rawabi.ps/plant.php 4 See: http://www.agriregionieuropa.univpm.it/materiale/2009/Final_Concept_paper.pdf A new Code of Corporate Governance has been launched by the Palestinian Capital Markets Authority (PCMA) and the National Committee for Corporate Governance.

This includes the provision of food and water, as well as cash handouts. Some donors have already responded and $2.5m has been committed by the United Arab Emirates, $1m by India and •1m by Italy. Mauritania, Egypt and Qatar have also each donated $20,000, $25,000 and $50,000 respectively. Based on the immediate response, and last year™s overall commitments from donors, UNRWA expect to secure enough funding to see their emergency service provision maintained at current levels throughout 2010.1Alongside the emergency fund, UNRWA™s General Fund provides core education, healthcare and social services. According to Gunness the working capital of the General Fund dropped to -$7.4m at the beginning of December 2009. Whilst the budget was balanced by the end of December, the General Fund starts 2010 increase their funding this year.In December the European Union pledged •10m to UNRWA™s education programmes and the UK donated £5m for the salaries of teachers working in UNRWA schools. Despite these pledges, Gunness said that the capacity of the General Fund to meet its current commitments, costing approximately $34m per month, is still being determined on a month by month basis.  This includes the salaries of UNRWA™s 30,000 employees. To remedy the situation, cuts to services are under consideration, including a reduction in key medical treatments. UNRWA Director of Operations in Gaza, John Ging, told the Bulletin that cuts to services in Gaza would have a devastating impact. ‚The most basic medical services are already on the brink of collapse, while the impoverished education system is completely overwhelmed by the 450,000 children in Gaza. A lack of education spells doom for an entire generation, and dampens prospects for recovery and future development in Gaza™ he said.  There could also be a wider economic impact if UNRWA jobs have to be cut or salary payments are delayed.there has been an increase in the number of individuals dependent upon UNRWA assistance. Second, there has been a decline in the contributions of major donors.

While entrepreneurship is distributed among a variety of sectors, the services sector is dominant.  The report investigated the motivation of those starting businesses and found that across the Palestinian Territory for every 41 entrepreneurs motivated by necessity, 100 were motivated by economic opportunity. The rate of necessity-driven entrepreneurship is higher in Gaza due to the scarcity of business opportunities there.Financing remained a major issue for Palestinian entrepreneurs; the median start-up capital for a new business was $2,095, which is high compared government programmes and informal investors.

Quarterly GDP per capita reached $373, an increase of 4.7% compared to Q1 2010 and 6% compared to Q2 2009. The biggest increases in economic activity were recorded in construction (up 29% since Q2 2009), agriculture (up 17%) and trade (up 14%).2Growth in the West Bank (6.2%) was almost double that of Gaza (3.3%) in six months of 2010 and 2009, when the Gazan economy grew by 16% and the West Bank economy grew by 8%. However, the growth in Gaza comes from a very low base, with the comparison made to the period of Operation Cast Lead. Living standards in Gaza are still said to be 60% below those in 1994.3There are concerns that the current level of growth is not sustainable given the high proportion of economic activity generated by services and the public sector (almost 40% of total activity).

Palestine has a very open economy, unlike many countries in the region. We welcome and protect foreign investors. I am very proud of this openness. Despite the challenges, we need to use each and every opportunity to market Palestinian products abroad, to reach new international markets and to give export oriented companies the opportunity to grow. participate in the global EXPO, taking place in Milan. What sector offers the greatest opportunities moving forward?One sector that I believe is particularly important for the Palestinian economy is industry, unfortunately, trade has become dependent on the Israeli market, 97% of imports and 89% of exports are made to/from or through Israel. Tourism is also important for the Palestinian economy. great potential, especially if the political situation is stable.The labour market continues to be characterised by very high unemployment. What should the priorities be for job creation?In order to create employment, sustainable projects are needed. The Palestinian economy is heavily dependent on donors, which come with limited-time projects. Such projects, especially in infrastructure, offer direct, immediate jobs but are not sustainable. Moving forward, additional job creation will need to come from the private sector.  How do you see the role of the private sector and what can the government do to support businesses™ efforts?The Ministry will work closely with the private sector. meetings with representatives of the private sector. I will remain very open and continue to promote  dialogue. In terms of policy, we will focus on creating an adequate enabling environment for expanding businesses. During my time at the PCMA, I noticed that although listed grow. These are public companies, which means that they are looking for investors, but they cannot rely on Palestinian money alone. Thus, foreign investments are of crucial importance. To boost foreign investment we need to work on key economic laws. My short-term priority will that in 2015 companies in the West Bank operate under Jordanian law from 1964, while business in Gaza work under Egyptian law, dated back to 1929.

Among Palestinians aged 15-29 average unemployment was around 35% while labour force participation also remained low at around 40%.

Prime Minister Fayyad announced on 4 February that the PA will distribute phase of reconstruction.1 The Minister of Planning, Samir Abdullah, expects the reconstruction efforts will restore infrastructure in Gaza to December 2008 levels. There are still no accurate estimates of total economic losses, according to Cairo Arafat, Director General of Aid Management Coordination in the Ministry of Planning. While the rubble remains, the severity of the damage to waste water networks, wells and other parts of the infrastructure (aside from electricity) is largely unknown. Estimates are still very rough. In the meantime, the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR) and the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) 2 estimated that the losses in Gaza exceeded $1.9bn. The international donor community have begun to respond to appeals for urgent humanitarian aid and reconstruction. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon made an urgent appeal for Gaza on 29 January for $613m to cover the coming six to nine months. The appeal has collected $130m so far, including $20m from the US, $10m from Japan, $9m from the UK, $7m from Spain, $5m from Finland, $4m from Denmark and $4m from France. The European Commission committed •32m to the appeal and a further •66m to UNRWA™s core budget.

In the intervening years we have sought to provide accurate insights into the Palestinian economy to our local and global readership. This month I am proud to introduce our 100th issue. I would like to express gratitude to all those who have contributed to the Bulletin over the years. In particular, I would like to thank our partners at MAS for their work and support each month. Without them the Bulletin would not be possible. At the same time, it would be remiss not to acknowledge our readers, not just for reading the Bulletin each month but also for their constructive feedback.As I write, we are at a time of political uncertainty and economic slowdown following the collapse of the peace negotiations in April 2014 and the war in Gaza last summer. Preliminary estimates indicate that the Palestinian economy improvement previously. GDP per capita has only increased marginally over the last two decades and is estimated to have fallen by 5.5% in 2014. In Gaza, GDP per capita has declined by 33% since 1994. Total unemployment is estimated at 27%, with unemployment rates of youth aged 20-24 in the West Bank and Gaza of 27.5% and 68.3%, respectively.The Portland Trust continues to believe that a vibrant private sector-led economy is crucial for sustainable growth and job creation, as well as for peace in the region to take hold. During 2014 we have, therefore, sustained our efforts to support the development of Palestinian businesses through the implementation of ‚Beyond Aid™, an economic initiative by the Palestinian private sector which envisages the creation of almost 400,000 jobs by 2030.1However, it must be acknowledged that any private sector development efforts will be seriously constrained without an improvement to the enabling environment and, in particular, political progress leading to the creation of a thriving Palestinian state. It is therefore absolutely crucial that all concerned parties work together towards achieving a peace efforts.  We hope that the Palestinian Economic Bulletin will continue to inform the public debate and inspire business, policy makers and international organisations to direct their efforts towards the creation of a sustainable economy.  Sir Ronald CohenChairman, The Portland Trust 1 www.portlandtrust.org/publications/beyond-aid-palestinian-private-sector-initiative-investment-growth-and-employmentDr. Nabeel Kassis, MAS Director GeneralMAS perceives its partnership with The Portland Trust as one of high value that enables us to reach out to a Palestinian economy. For MAS, the Palestinian Economic Bulletin is a vital instrument for dispersing knowledge about the Palestinian economy domestically, regionally, and internationally. The constantly growing readership is a testimony of the success of this endeavour. Through its nearly decade-long history (since 2006) and its 100 issues, the Bulletin has recorded moments of impressive growth as well as disappointing stagnation and even declines in the economy. Last year was a challenging one for all, especially the second half following the devastating effects of the war in the summer in Gaza.

Nominal GDP per capita reached $3,186 in 2013, registering stark differences between the West Bank ($4,200) and Gaza ($1,715).1 Overall real GDP growth slowed in Q4 2013, reaching only 0.3% with respect to the previous quarter (as a result of a 1.2% increase in the West Bank and a 2.3% drop in Gaza).

It is broadly recognised that much of the growth over these years was largely fueled by donor support. As international aid declined in the years running up to 2012 the Palestinian economy consequently slowed. Sustainable recovery sector-led growth. Comparing the contributions of key economic sectors over time it appears that there has been an underlying structural shift in the Palestinian economy.

Conversely the retail sector is now a larger part of the economy, increasing from 9.8% in 2004 to 17.8% in 2013. The construction sector contributed over 11% to Palestinian GDP in 2013.

The conference, attended by representatives of EU and Arab League countries, the World Bank, the IMF, various UN agencies and different Arab and Islamic organisations, secured a total of $5.4bn in pledges from international donors. Around half of this sum is expected to be directly allocated to Gaza, with the rest going to support other funding needs of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).2 Funding for much needed early recovery and reconstruction works is expected to include major contributions from Qatar ($1bn), the EU ($568m), the US ($212m), the UAE ($200m) and Turkey ($200m).3 Discussions during the conference also focused on the need to strengthen the Palestinian government™s ability to assume its responsibilities in the rehabilitation of Gaza, as well as the necessary mechanisms to enable the import and export of goods and materials to and from Gaza (by building on existing efforts by the UN). Prior to the conference, the Palestinian government™s Higher Inter-Ministerial Committee for Gaza Recovery and Reconstruction presented an impact assessment of the latest operation and a comprehensive strategy for the implementation of recovery measures.4 The governmental plan, developed with assistance from a broad range of stakeholders (including Palestinian line ministries, the local private sector and different international organisations), is aimed at transitioning from urgent relief efforts to longer-term development needs, across four areas: social protection, infrastructure, economic development and governance and institution building. While short-term efforts will focus on ensuring rapid improvements to the lives of the thousands of affected citizens, the government™s long-term vision for Gaza The PNA plan is structured around three phases (Table 1): an urgent relief phase including rapid and short-term interventions ($414m); an early recovery phase involving interventions of up to 12 months ($1.2bn); and a reconstruction and development phase, expected to be implemented over the longer term ($2.4bn). The social sector chapter of the plan is aimed at combatting poverty, vulnerability and food insecurity in Gaza, which increased sharply as a result of extensive 1 www.mfa.gov.eg/gazaconference/default_en.html2 www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29586636 3 already pledged, bringing the total U.S. contribution to $414 million.

As part of this, of the census. The use of GIS devices in the production of the census will allow for more reliable data at the lowest possible geographical level to be collected in a time in the development of the National Statistical System.Another priority is collecting data on Palestinians in Diaspora, where we have already implemented two surveys in coordination with the UN and other relevant governmental agencies within Lebanon. We are currently in the preparation phase to conduct a Population Census for the Palestinian Refugees in Refugee Camps and Localities nearby the camps in Lebanon.What are your strategies for adapting to such volatile environment?PCBS keeps on working uninterruptedly under the most challenging circumstances, even during the Gaza war last is answering their needs of data covering all aspects of life, we have adopted several strategies such as: enforcing the focusing on the capacity building of our staff, as they are the resource that we depend on to keep functioning and be able to secure reliable data in a timely manner.  PCBS is characterized by its innovative and open approach and agenda. What are some of the top innovations you™re seeing in the collection and use of statistics? PCBS focuses on strengthening statistical knowledge and raising awareness of statistics. As part of this work, PCBS is ensuring that the school curricula contains statistics We use a variety of media such as cartoons, animation, and infographics to create and enhance awareness among our students. Furthermore, through adopting social media such as the PCBS Website, Facebook, and Twitter, we ensure that data is disseminated in a wider range of people. This has improved our interaction with the public as, generally speaking, statistics reports are not easily understood by non-specialized personnel.  Statistics (IAOS). What are your goals as the head of such prestigious organization, and what does it mean for Palestine and the region?To begin with, on the personal level I am very happy with this accomplishment as I was not seeking for this post but rather nominated to it by other member countries. I believe this will help put Palestine on the global map and is recognition of the high professionalism of our organization.  My goal as the President of IAOS is to strengthen the organization through better engagement with its members. My strategy for achieving this includes four that the work of IAOS is relevant to its members and to other peer organizations. Second, maintain visibility at statistical events to maintain an appropriate role in global statistical directions. Third, build new partnerships and develop existing ones so IAOS can better serve the global statistical community. Finally, institutionalize the work of IAOS so that in the future the organization can focus on developmental issues rather than managerial matters.has been elected as the president of IAOS and such an opportunity is a golden one. It will assist in shedding light on how data is being produced under challenging circumstances, which are no longer limited to Palestine but are being faced by various countries within the region such as Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Yemen, and Libya. Such data is of high importance since it can help show what is happening on the ground and what interventions should be mobilized.I aim to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries in several international priorities such as moving from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Finally, one of our goals will be to draw attention to the challenges faced I believe if we are able to succeed in this, we will leave a well needed imprint on the global agenda.'),\n",

This expansion followed a sharp contraction of 9.1% in Q3 2014 following the war in Gaza. Real GDP in the West Bank ($1,470.9m) increased by 4% from Q3 2014 and by 4.9% from Q4 2013. In Gaza, which had seen real GDP fall by 28.4% in Q3 2014, GDP rose by 18.5% in the last quarter of 2014 to $407.7m, indicating a partial recovery from the economic damage caused by the war in the summer. Public administration and defence continued to make up a very high proportion of GDP in Gaza, at 35.6%, compared to just 7% in the West Bank. Much of the growth in Gaza was driven by improvements in construction and wholesale & retail trade (up by 64%, although again still substantially lower than the levels achieved throughout 2013 and up to Q2 2014). However, compared to the corresponding quarter in 2013, real GDP in Gaza was down 18.3%, highlighting that Gaza has a long way to go to even achieve parity with the already depressed economic conditions of 2013. For 2014 as a whole, national real GDP is estimated to have decreased by 0.4% overall, which when disaggregated translates into a 5.1% rise in the West Bank and a substantial 15.2% fall in Gaza.

The trade dispute reached its height on 9 February, when the GoI imposed a ban on all Palestinian agricultural exports, both through Israeli ports and via Jordan, the West Bank™s only direct export route to the outside world.2 According to the Palestinian Export Council, which mobilized in early February to coordinate the Palestinian response to these measures, preventing Palestinians from exporting agricultural products to the rest of the world is considered a breach of the Paris Protocol and World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements.The ban occurred at the peak of the agricultural export season and two months prior to Ramadan, when demand for agricultural produce is at its peak. These developments put further strain on the Palestinian agricultural sector, which faces limited access to land, water, and international markets. Further economic threats face the sector if the GoI proceeds with the annexation of the Jordan Valley,3  which accounts for 60% of vegetables produced in the West Bank and almost 100% of the date harvest in Palestine. On 5 February, a few days prior to the announcement of the total ban, the PNA announced its intention to limit the entry of Israeli products into the Palestinian market, focusing on vegetables, fruits, juices, mineral water, and carbonated drinks.4 It™s decision was in response to an earlier development, on 31 January, when the Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett directed the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to halt the imports of all Palestinian agricultural products into Israel. Palestine exports around $132m of agricultural goods annually, of which 68% ($88m) are exported to Israel.5 Palestinian exports to Israel include tomatoes, potatoes, beans, cucumbers, peppers, onions, and zucchini.6 a solution to the cattle issue. In response, the PNA asserted that the GoI had not abided by the agreement reached in December 2019, whereby the GoI would allow direct import of 10,000 calves from abroad, setting up a special cattle quarantine station and entry of Palestinian eggs to Israeli markets. Trade tensions have been on the rise since September 2019, when the PNA announced its decision to cease calf imports from Israel.7 According to the PNA, this move was a part of a broader strategy to diversify sources of imports and decrease reliance on the Israeli economy.8 123 https://bit.ly/2V8cN7G; https://bit.ly/3bUdjfJ; and see B157 https://bit.ly/2VjsJEq 4 http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=x43r4va115027915827ax43r4v5 https://bit.ly/2vnjGr0; https://bit.ly/2SiSUZK67 See B158 for further details: https://bit.ly/2vaJU07  8 www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/275400'),\n",

Olive farming and processing constitutes up to 25% of Palestinian agricultural income and supports the livelihood of around 100,000 families (including 80,000 land-owning households and 20,000 waged workers employed during the annual olive harvest).2 In recent years, 2006 registered a record high olive processing volume of 160,000 tonnes, while 2009, with only 20,000 tonnes processed, was the least productive year since 2003. resources imposed by the Israeli Government over the past decades severely limited access to land prevents farmers from taking adequate care of their groves, including soil tillage and pruning of trees, regarded as important factors to improve trees™ productivity. Other factors further constrain productivity. A recent study by the Palestinian National Center for Agricultural Research shows that the level of scrap (waste) in Palestinian olive presses is far from optimal. Monitoring of almost 300 presses over three months showed that more than 70% of all presses operate with over 10% wasted oil in peat, above the 5-8% international average. Only 8 presses in Palestine registered less than 5% waste in peat, indicating a large scope productivity. Incentives also play a key role, as the study showed that scrap was lower in presses where labour wages were tied to productivity. 1 www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_PCBS/Downloads/book2034.pdf 2In Q4 2013 almost 191,000 guests spent around 490,000 guest nights in hotels in the West Bank and East JerusalemThe fourth National Economic Dialogue Conference took place in Ramallah In 2013 total exports of goods from Palestine amounted to $839.4m, while total imports reached $4,579.8m The Palestine Capital Market Authority was admitted as the 124th ordinary member of the International Organization of Securities CommissionsThe Centre for Youth Economic Empowerment participated in a week-long social entrepreneurship workshop in BelgiumThe second conference on Cooperation among East Asian Countries for Palestinian Development was held in IndonesiaThe Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

The report presents a concrete steps which can be taken now to help support private sector led growth.1The report notes that the main constraints to private sector development are the restrictions imposed by the Government of Israel (GoI), but argues that it is very important for the Palestinian Authority (PA) to take steps to improve the business environment, both to help prepare the ground for a future possible state and to encourage increased investment now. The World Bank suggests several priorities to help improve the business environment: accelerating the process of land registration; continuing to develop beyond the banking sector; establishing an independent telecommunications regulator and making more progress in the legal environment, including passing the competition law.  A substantial section of the report is devoted to steps that can be taken to improve problem, the World Bank points out that high unemployment rates can also be caused by skill mismatches where workers are not equipped for the demands of skills as well as the low level of competencies and experience of graduates to be among the most important constraints to employment of youth in the West Bank and Gaza.™ The World Bank suggests that although the PA has ensured high levels of school attendance and literacy, it needs to do more to support innovative programmes with an emphasis on critical thinking, problem-solving and hands-on learning experiences. In line with this, the World Bank recommends strengthening ties between the technical and vocational education and training institutions and the private sector. In addition, the PA needs to facilitate the transition from education to work by providing graduates with job matching services.Regarding early childhood development, the Bank highlights some of the PA™s successes: for instance the West Bank and Gaza is an outstanding performer in terms of indicators for early childhood nutrition. Equally, school enrollment has always been high, and access to primary education is near universal. However despite this, the quality of education and basic learning outcomes need to be improved.In terms of foreign trade, the World Bank underlines that the Palestinian economy needs to focus on trade in intermediate goods and on exports of high value products. a better business environment (to attract investment), improved trade facilitation (to reduce costs) and a highly skilled labour force with high levels of productivity.1 siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/GrowthStudyEng.pdfThe Palestinian Authority and Government of Israel have agreed on new arrangements regarding the transfer of goods between Israel and the Palestinian Territory and related tax procedures.

Under its baseline scenario, which assumes no major changes in the economic and political situation, the PCBS forecast 3.8% growth in real GDP in 2016 resulting in 0.9% growth in real GDP per capita. The number of employees is forecast to rise by 7.7% bringing unemployment down to 25%. Government revenues are forecast to increase by 4.6% due to improvements in tax collection while Government expenses would fall by 1.7%, resulting in a 3.5% by 1.9%. This is due to an expected rise in the value of Palestinian imports by 3.9% and an increase in value of Palestinian exports by 7.4%.The PMA acknowledges that economic forecasts are sensitive to changes in economic and political stability, especially in the Palestinian context characterised by a high-risk environment. If the present economic and political conditions continue, the PMA forecasts a 3.3% growth in real GDP in 2016. Growth would be driven by an increase in private consumption fuelled by a rise in indebtedness and banking loans. The contribution of private consumption to real GDP is expected to rise to 79.9%, while the public sector contribution would decline to 21%.  Exports and imports are forecast to increase by 6.6% and 8.3%, rate climbs to 2%.These baseline projections for 2016 are similar to those presented by the IMF in September 20153. In the Report to the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, the IMF forecast real GDP growth of 3.9% in 2016. Unemployment was forecast to rise to 28% and The Annual Reports analyse the potential risks, both positive and negative, that are likely to impact key economic indicators and set out a number of scenarios. The PCBS ﬁoptimisticﬂ scenario, which is based on an improved political and economic situation, forecasts the economy to expand by 7% leading to a 4% increase in real GDP per capita. The unemployment rate would decline to 23.1% after an 11.6% increase in the number of employees. Government revenues and expenditure would rise by 13.4% and 9.8% respectively. As expenditure is greater The PMA forecasts that economic growth might reach 7.1% in 2016 should positive economic and political shocks occur, including an improvement in the political and security conditions, acceleration in the reconstruction of Gaza and the implementation of major projects.1 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_Forecasting2016E.pdf2 http://bit.ly/20s6fuK and http://bit.ly/1QrBukY3 www.imf.org/external/country/WBG/RR/2015/092115.pdfPresident Mahmoud Abbas approved the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) budget for 2016 in January.

The trade challenges are on the supply side. Exports include olive oil, stone and marble and furniture and constitute 7% of GDP, when the average for lower middle-income countries is 17%.The main developmental problems are trade policy having been conditioned by the Paris Protocol and national developmental plans never prioritising trade policy. The latter is changing as the new national strategy gives more attention to trade policy. With regards to industrial policies, all efforts have been focused on improving the business only 81 manufacturing companies employing more than 50 workers. Most of the economy is comprised of family-run micro and small enterprises with a high proportion of family workers. Who are Palestine™s key strategic trade partners and what is the way forward to enhance trade with them?Palestine is exporting around $10m to Europe per year, $5m to the US and practically nothing to Canada although we have free market access. The most utilised agreement is the Greater Arab Free Trade Agreement (GAFTA). The problem is that there is no supply-side capacity. Palestine does not have the products which the world market is demanding. You cannot export what you produce; you should export what the world wants. Even in GAFTA, 67% of the increase in exports is due to olive oil, stone and marble. The way forward is to look at what the world wants and what of that Palestine can produce and then implement industrial policies to develop those sectors.What is the optimal trade regime under the current circumstances?Soon our project will present a proposal of trade policy for Palestine, including a tariff component. In a study that will be published by MAS soon, we are analysing what would be the most appropriate tariff policy. What is clear is that the Paris Protocol arrangements are completely dysfunctional for the Palestinian economy. The tariff schedule adequate for Israel is not adequate for Palestine, which needs to use tariffs as an instrument of industrial policy Œ to lower the cost of some inputs and protect sectors that have potential. It is the typical ﬁinfant industryﬂ argument. New companies need time to become competitive. WTO? What are the next steps towards its realisation?Palestine is de facto implementing all WTO obligations, because of the Paris Protocol and because Israel is a is the availability of the dispute settlement mechanism, a forum where small countries can defend their interests. Another one is that the WTO agreements are international best practices in many areas, such as technical standards and trade facilitation for the private sector, so being a member would allow Palestine to put its house in order.before starting accession negotiations, which last up to ten years. Palestine requested an observer status in 2009, but no action was taken. Now the Government is exploring the possibility of presenting another request.

Government, the private sector and civil society organisations are under increasing pressure to help tackle these problems, in a context of declining levels of aid. Social impact investment is one tool that governments all over the world are using to solve enduring social and economic problems youth unemployment (UK) and supporting small scale farmers (Peru).Impact investments can have greatest impact when funding is linked to outcomes. Traditionally, commissioners prescribe and pay for a particular service that they believe will lead to a desired social outcome, known as a ‚fee for service™ contract. However, commissioners are moving towards funding approaches that pay on the basis of outcomes (e.g. reduced unemployment) rather than activities (session In a DIB, investors are repaid by non-government parties such as aid agencies and philanthropists. DIBs, therefore, are part of an effort to apply and adapt SIBs to international development. For this reason, use of outcomes contracts in Palestine may initially be driven by DIBs.This note looks at how impact bonds have been used around the world and sets out how DIBs could best be applied in Palestine. It is organised as follows:In theory - what are impact bonds and why are they useful?In practice Œ when are they useful and at what scale?Next steps - actions to accelerate the use of DIBs in Palestine.Outcomes ContractAny contract between a government and a service provider that involves some element of payment for outcomes achieved, also known as Payment by Results (PbR).CommissionerAny government, donor or foundation with responsibility for buying service provision (typically from an external provider).Social Impact Bond (SIB)Any arrangement made by a service provider to access off-InvestorThe role of the investor in a SIB or DIB contract is to provide funds upfront for services, to be repaid if outcomes are achieved.Development Impact Bond (DIB)The DIB is conceptually the same as a SIB, but non-government parties (such as aid agencies and philanthropists) pay for the outcomes delivered instead of the government.Outcomes FunderThe role of the outcomes funder in a SIB or DIB contract is to have been achieved.use in Palestine remains embryonic. Four priority actions could accelerate the use of DIBs in Palestine:1.Provide support for capacity building for service providers.Services providers, especially early adopters, may requireadditional resources to perform under an outcomes contract,compared to contracting on a pure fee for service basis. Forexample, service providers have to be able to demonstratetheir impact and that they can take on additional funds andscale up their activities. They also have to possess requisitebusiness planning competences to reassure investors thatmoney will be spent judiciously. Grants and business supportcould be made available on a rolling basis to help supportinvestment and bid for outcomes contracts.In the U.S., the Social Innovation Fund Pay for SuccessInitiative awarded over $20m to support feasibility andtechnical assistance for SIBs. More than 50 service providersare currently using federal funds to explore feasibility orsupport project development.  Grants have increasinglyfocused on building the enabling infrastructure for suchprojects, especially cross-system data sharing.  To date, 15SIB transactions have closed in the U.S.2.Support coordination and collaboration between donors.Donors can play the role of either investor or market builderor both. The Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) of the Inter-American Development Bank has allocated $5.3m to exploreSIBs across Latin America. The programme offers support forthe design of and investment in SIBs, including by creatinglocal capabilities amongst governments and other parties.with the goal of lifting poor, female-head households out ofpoverty. The State of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and the Municipalityof Buenos Aires (Argentina) are also receiving MIF™s supportfor the development of SIBs.The fragmentation of public spending across differentgovernment departments and authorities can makeUK Government establishing its Social Outcomes FinanceFund, which acts as an additional central funding streamand encourages different departments to contribute to SIBprojects. In Palestine, this could be addressed by donorscollectively creating a fund to contribute to outcome payments for DIBs.To date, the UK has allocated nearly £200m for outcomes funds. In the U.S., the Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for ResultsAct would establish a $300 million outcomes fund, housedapproved by the House of Representatives.  It is expected topass the House again in early 2017, with supporters hopeful for Senate passage.3.Improve metrics.  Outcomes measurement and evaluation arekey issues for SIBs and DIBs and may require additional skills to those required to contract on a fee for service basis. Building an evidence base of costs would help commissioners assess howmuch they would be willing to pay for outcomes. In 2013, theUK Government published a Unit Cost Database, a free onlineresource to facilitate SIB development which provides detailed National Advisory Board on Impact Investing provided apractical guide to understanding social costs, including applied examples on teen parenthood and homelessness.9 The NewSouth Wales Government has also committed to publishing unit cost data as part of their strategy.10Work in this area could build on existing efforts to developeffective performance management, such as OpenRBF (a tool11 and a standardized tool to cost early childhood interventions.124.Support awareness and knowledge sharing and information.terminology can be confusing.  The partnerships, the datacollection, setting metrics and payment mechanisms canbe new to commissioners and service providers and requireexplanation. These issues could be addressed by providingonline information and resources relevant to DIBs. Forfor Social Impact Bonds as a central resource for knowledgeand best practice for central and local government, deliverypartners, investors and intermediaries.At the global level, The Global Social Impact InvestmentSteering Group (GSG) was established in August 2015 asthe successor to the Social Impact Investment Taskforceestablished by the G8. The GSG works to catalyse a globalsocial impact investment market across its current 13 member countries plus the EU, as well as through active observers from government and leading network organisations supportiveof impact investment, including the OECD and the GlobalImpact Investing Network.

Where do you source your production and packing inputs? In 1998 we franchised the production of Taybeh Beer in Germany to access European markets, following From there we source the German market and also export to other European countries. In 2005 we began exporting directly to Japan from Palestine, where all Carrefour stores now sell our beer, together with other Palestinian products. We are now also considering brewing Taybeh Beer in Jordan, after we had to stop exporting there due to a major increase in taxes by the Jordanian authorities. We are also exploring opportunities to brew Taybeh beer in the USA.Regarding inputs, we have to import everything but water: our malt comes from Belgium and France; hops from Bavaria and the Czech Republic; yeast from England and packaging material from Israel. We used to import bottles from Portugal but then shipping containers started to be repeatedly held in the Israeli port, for periods of up to 70 days. Because of this we had to face extra storage costs and custom fees (making a bottle originally costing 0.5 Israeli supplier.How do you see the prospects for the Palestinian economy?The current situation is very challenging but I am hopeful we will have a bright future if we achieve peace and stability.

Establishments closed down; there was no tourism and with no port or airport in Palestine and all of our inputs coming via Israel, we had to lay off staff and faced closure. I remember that many who had returned after Oslo closed their businesses and left Palestine.

Moreover, the winery is located on the ground level of the new 80-room Taybeh Golden Hotel we are currently constructing as part of our activities in the tourism sector. Will you continue to organise the Oktoberfest festival in Taybeh alongside these new developments? How did the idea of the festival come about? From the beginning our company has been orientated towards tourism and we want to play an active role in the industry. Whilst I was Mayor of Taybeh from 2005 I helped create the Taybeh Oktoberfest. The festival has now run for eight years, attracting tourists from all over the world to visit Taybeh and to experience the culture, music, food and drink of Palestine. We also encourage those attending the festival to buy local products, including olive oil, honey, soap and embroidery. We hope that Oktoberfest will carry on for many years to come and that local tourism is further enhanced by the new hotel, which will be integrated with the winery and micro-brewery, as part of a broader agritourism offering in Taybeh.

Some of the largest Palestinian private sector players are partnering and sponsoring the event. In addition, international support is coming from USAID, DFID and the Islamic Development Bank.2The conference hopes to encourage business relations between regional and international investors and the Palestinian private sector. A number of announcements about new investment programmes and partnerships are anticipated. Details of the work being done to improve The Director General of PIPA, and the CEO of the conference, Jafaar Hdaib, told the Bulletin that ‚the event is an important milestone on the path to establishing the Palestinian State which is part of Prime Minister Dr. Salam Fayyad™s two-year plan ‚Ending the Occupation, Building the State™ (2009-2011). Palestinian companies to be showcased come from a variety of sectors, including manufacturing, tourism, IT, housing and construction, agriculture, energy and infrastructure. The agenda includes sectoral and plenary sessions, B2B meetings, cultural activities and off site visits. There will be a welcome reception and dinner on 1 June and Palestinian following day. An exhibition of Palestinian products will run alongside the main event.According to Hdaib 1,100 foreign participants have registered for the conference, far exceeding expectations. Over half of registered participants are the heads or general managers of the companies they represent. Around 540 are coming from the Arab world, 200 from Europe, the US and Canada and the remaining 360 are Palestinian Diaspora. PIPA and the PA are making logistical arrangements to ease participants™ entry to Bethlehem and applying for permits where necessary.1  See: http://www.pic-palestine.ps/ 2 For details of PIC partners and sponsors See: http://www.pic-palestine.ps/etemplate.php?id=86Private sector credit from the banking sector was $1.56bn at the end of January 2010, up from $1.18bn at the end of December 2008. The loan to deposit ratio was 36%, up from 31% at the end of January 2009.28 out of 36 companies were recorded by PALTEL ($23.2m).According to Paltrade there has been a 52% increase in the number of trucks leaving the West Bank with exports compared to last year. PCBS forecast that the value of exports will increase 3.4% this year. Support for the PA budget has recently been provided by the UK ($25m), the EU ($10m) and Algeria ($26m).The baseline scenario assumes the situation in the Palestinian Territory remains the same as 2009. It forecasts a 4.2% increase in real GDP, a 1.3% increase in GDP per capita and that private investment will reach $1,454m.If there was political and economic progress in 2010 then the PCBS expects real GDP to increase by 8.8% and real GDP per capita by 5.8%. Private investment would increase by 6.5% to reach $1,484m. This optimistic scenario assumes a fully-funded reconstruction effort in the Gaza Strip, an increase in the number of Palestinian workers employed in Israel, ongoing support for the PA budget and increased implementation of investment and development projects in the Palestinian Territory.However if political and economic conditions deteriorate, and external donor support falls, the PCBS predicts a 6% contraction in real GDP, an 8.6% fall in real GDP per capita and a drop in private investment of 2.8%.A comparison between the 2009 forecast and actual results shows that GDP growth of 6.8% in 2009 far exceeded even the optimistic forecast (3.2% growth). The IMF baseline and pessimistic forecasts published in the Bulletin last month are comparable to the PCBS optimistic and baseline scenario respectively. The IMF did not publish an optimistic scenario.24 Listings on the PSEThere are now 40 companies listed on the Palestine Securities Exchange (PSE). On 14 April 10m shares in the National Towers Company (ABRAJ) were listed and The Palestine Insurance Company (PICO) was listed on trading.

The most recent data reveals GDP growth of only 0.5% in Gaza during 2017. Unemployment reached 44% during the same period, despite a low labour participation rate of 75% for males and 18% for females. The quality of life for most Gaza residents is deteriorating, especially as access to basic utilities and services has continued to decline.1 Electricity ShortageBy 6 February 2018, emergency electricity generators ran out of fuel in three out of Gaza™s 13 hospitals and 14 out of its 54 medical centres.2 On 14 February, the Gaza supply of diesel fuel required to operate the plant.3 The possibility of additional medical facilities shutting down due to the lack of electricity was averted through a $3.5m donation towards emergency fuel supplies from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and the State of Qatar. The donation covers 54% of the $6.5m required for the most critical medical facilities to continue their operations in 2018.4While the GPP™s total capacity is 140 MW, since 22 January 2018, it has produced at most 25 MW of electricity. The lack of fuel to operate the plant is mainly due to political and funding disputes which impact the provision of fuel imported from Egypt.5 Housing ShortageHasayneh announced that Gaza requires about 125,000 new housing units to meet current demand, in addition to 24,000 existing housing units that require full reconstruction.614,000 housing units each year on average. Currently, there are 285,000 housing units in Gaza, of which 55,000 need restoration or rehabilitation, while 20% of the Palestinian families in Gaza live in densely populated residential units with population growth rates of at least 3.3%.7 Gaza Reconstruction MechanismA joint review of the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism (GRM) has been agreed between the Government of Israel (GoI) and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) following a meeting on 14 February with Palestinian Prime Minister Dr. Rami Hamdallah, the GoI™s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), Major General Yoav Mordechai, and United Nations (UN) Special Coordinator Mr. 1 https://bit.ly/2DPE6aM 2 https://reut.rs/2HYAV2W 34567On 1 March 2018, the North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment Facility in Brussels on the Gaza Central Desalination Plant on 20 March 2018, raising •456m for what will be the biggest ever infrastructure On 13 March 2018, the Reconstruction and a $5m loan to Cairo Amman Palestinian businessesto study the use of social media in Palestine, released Social and Digital Media in Palestine during 2017The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

A standing clause in the Palestinian budget stipulates that ﬁshould we receive additional external budget support, we will allocate it to the repayment of arrears.ﬂ 4 Since disbursed foreign aid has always been less than promised, the PA has been unable to pay old bills.With its limited resources, the PA has established priorities for its outgoing often funded by the EC and European countries. For example, this month the EU and Sweden contributed •24.7m for the payment of wages and pensions to public sector employees and retirees, and the EU has agreed to frontload of 2012 to help address the crisis.5 Operational expenditures and payments to local entities are high in the priorities list in order to stimulate economic growth or at least prevent collapse.

This assumes that the situation in the Palestinian Territory remains as it was in 2008. The Islamic National Bank opened in Gaza on 21 April, making it the Palestinian Monetary Authority control.

The results show high levels of dissatisfaction with infrastructure and facilities in Gaza, room for improvement in the provision of reliable services to businesses in Gaza, an essential enabling factor to sustain economic growth in the long term.

Helping the private sector in Gaza to recover after severe interruption of economic activity during the war is an absolute priority. More than 420 industrial enterprises were destroyed, 36,000 dunams of agricultural land were damaged and 13,000 greenhouses were partially or totally demolished. In the aftermath of the operation it was reported that up to 30,000 workers employed in affected establishments were unable to work. Through GBB more than 50 companies are expected to receive support in the next 6-9 months to Þnance maintenance services, conduct assessment studies, acquire inputs, buy and install machinery, repair and reconstruct facilities, rent space for temporary relocation (for a period of up to 6 months) and cover labour and transport costs. The programme™s new window offers a Þxed grant of 75% of total funding needs (with the rest being covered by the beneÞciaries), in comparison to the original range of 25-75%. Grant ceilings per company will remain unchanged at £50,000. Priority will be given to businesses able to create signiÞcant impact in the short term while also delivering sustainable success beyond the period of assistance. Other criteria for eligibility focus on ease of implementation, including the availability of production inputs.In related news, after visiting Gaza on 11 December, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Mr Robert Serry, announced that pursuant to the trilateral agreement reached between the Palestinian Government, the Government of Israel and the UN earlier in September 2014, some 20,000 home owners in Gaza would have access to much needed building materials for the repair of their damaged homes by the end of the month.2 The UN-brokered mechanism aims to ensure that construction materials entering Gaza are exclusively used for their intended purpose, for which the UN has agreed to undertake checks to monitor compliance. The donor-funded mechanism has been subject to criticism by Palestinian businesses and individuals following delays in its effective implementation, with local sources reporting that the ßow of materials into Gaza has not improved consistently. While security concerns regarding the use of materials need to be addressed, some regard the different 1 www.pmdp.ps/page.php?id=984fy38991Y984f2 www.bit.ly/1vIMe0JAn MoU was signed between Palestine and Turkey for the establishment of an organised tax-free industrial zone in JeninGlobal Entrepreneurship Week was celebrated for a second consecutive year in Palestine, culminating with 10 start-ups pitching to local and international investorsInnovation Fund, the Þrst post-accelerator investment vehicle for Palestinian start-ups, was launchedQ3 2014 saw a signiÞcant decrease in hotel activities.

The purpose of the changes is to create a more attractive investment climate in the Palestinian Territory, thereby further encouraging investment, increasing exports, creating jobs and supporting the development process.1 Preparation of the new law began after the second Palestine Investment Conference took place in Bethlehem June last year. Several workshops and sessions, led by the Ministry of National Economy, were held 2 One of the most important amendments aims to simplify investment procedures and reduce bureaucracy. The existing investment department has been reformed with representatives from the relevant ministries (including the Ministry of National Economy, Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Finance) playing a bigger role. This will facilitate the faster processing of important licenses and permits. The investment department will also be responsible for following up with investors and ministries as required. The Palestinian Investment Promotion Agency (PIPA) will also be reformed. The PIPA Board will be increased to include 17 members, seven of which will be representatives of private sector institutions and a representative of the Ministry of Local government.3 The amendments grant tax exemptions and incentives to new sectors such as real estate development and environmental projects as well as amending the terms of exemption for other sectors. For example, projects in the ICT sector are now granted tax exemptions based on the number of employees, not on the size of capital. Tourism, health and education projects are granted additional exemptions from customs duties and taxes on procurement of furniture and enjoy the same incentives and exemptions. if recommended by the PIPA Board and approved by the Council of Ministers.4 The minimum threshold for eligible investment projects has been raised to The law is yet to be put into effect, as this will follow a public information campaign about the new law, which will take place in Palestinian newspapers later in February or early March.

Real GDP is expected to increase by 0.5% and the GDP per capita to decrease by 2%. The unemployment rate is expected to stay high, at 31.5% in 2019. The Optimistic Scenario4 assumes an improved political and economic situation that allows for real GDP to increase by 5% during 2019 and GDP per capita to increase by 2%. Unemployment would fall back to 2017 levels of 29% during 2019. The Pessimistic Scenario,5 assumes a deteriorating political and economic situation where GDP is projected to decrease by 3% during 2019 and GDP per capita would decrease by 5%. The number of Palestinian employees in Israel would decrease by 12%, thus increasing unemployment to 33%.The PMA™s separate forecasting exercise largely corresponds to the projections of the PCBS. Despite the different methodologies and modelling techniques employed, both forecasts agree on the range of possible GDP outcomes and are 6 However, in the baseline scenario, PMA™s forecasts project slightly higher real GDP and per capita GDP growth prospects, based on its expectation that the same challenges constraining economic growth in 2018 would continue. Furthermore, the range between the PMA™s worst and best outlook is narrower than that forecasted by PCBS.1 Given the limitations in obtaining economic data from Gaza, the forcasts do not allow separate modelling of the West Bank and Gazan economies.2 www.pcbs.gov.ps/post.aspx?lang=en&ItemID=3341 3budget, declining clearance revenues from Israel, increased government transfers, income tax collection and value of credit facilities, continuing restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries and population growth (birth and mortality rates) in Palestine remaining at current levels.4 Optimistic scenario economic and political assumptions based on political reconciliation between the West Bank and Gaza, reconstruction of Gaza and donor support for Government budget, increased clearance revenues increased development expenditure, decreased restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries, and population  (birth and mortality rates) growth below current levels.5 Pessimistic scenario economic and political assumptions based on decreased donor support for Government clearance value added taxes, decrease in income tax collection, and a decrease in development expenditures, increased restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries and the number of workers in Israel decreasing.6The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) published its preliminary estimates on the performance of the Palestinian Economy in 2018The Private Sector Coordination Council calls for an emergency economic development programme for GazaOn 23 December 2018, the PCBS published its Balance of Payments and International Investment Position reports for the third quarter of 2018On an annual basis, the Al-Quds index decreased by 7.9% compared to the last day of trading in 2017The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

The strategy was prepared by the PMA in cooperation with the banking sector and other stakeholders and was approved by the Palestinian Cabinet in mid-2018. the use of electronic payment methods in local transactions, in both the private and the public sectors. This includes the launch of a system that will allow for the automated electronic transfer of the wages of Palestinian workers in Israel directly to their personal bank accounts on a monthly basis and with minimal fees.1 The PMA will also work to allow the use of electronic payment cards issued by Israeli banks for purchases by Palestinians from Israel in local markets. According to the Governor  of the PMA, Mr Azzam Al Shawwa, the accumulation of New Israeli Shekels (NIS) in the Palestinian market is mainly caused by the excessive reliance on cash in local economic transactions, in addition to cash payment of the wages of  around130,000 Palestinian workers in Israel (a monthly average of around NIS 600 million), and the purchases made by Palestinian Israeli citizens when they visit the West Bank, estimated by the PMA at an average of NIS 250 million monthly.2 One of the main goals of the strategy is to curb the accumulation of Israeli Shekels in circulation in Palestine, due to the negative impact of the surplus on the stability of the Palestinian banking system and the Palestinian economy.3 The build-up of cash, mostly in shekels, in Palestinian markets is particularly costly to imposed on Palestinian banks by the Government of Israel (GoI).4 Any excess cash beyond the ceiling imposed by the GoI (currently limited to one billion Shekels per month5) continues to be retained within the Palestinian banking system with large quantities of cash, the loss of potential interest on cash (above permitted transfer ceilings) that might otherwise be deposited in Israeli banks, and the holdings by Palestinian banks of excessive surplus capital leading to a drag on their return on equity (ROE). 1 www.pma.ps/Default.aspx?tabid=205&ArtMID=793&ArticleID=2380&language=en-US 2 Around NIS 3 billion annually: these unrecorded ﬁexportsﬂ to Palestinian consumers from Israel are approximately equivalent in value to the total annual registered Palestinian merchandise exports to Israel.

The projected expenditure on public employees™ wages and salaries is around 5% higher than the amount spent in 2013, and represents slightly more than half of total expenditures.

The bottom line is that the peace process is extremely important, period. The upside of a just peace can only be good for both sides in terms of sustainability, stability and employment. The opportunity is simply too big and too positive to be ignored. Efforts by President Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are by far the largest, solution I have ever seen. Our hope is that the solution will be fair and balanced and uphold all the principles and values of freedom, equality and human rights. I also believe the opportunities exceed Palestine and Israel: by implementing the Arab Peace Initiative the potential is huge for all of the countries involved.

Instead, banks are required to reduce the ratio of foreign investments to total deposits from 65% to 55% by September 2009.1 The new regulations are intended to expand the size of local investments without imposing minimum lending requirements. It is hoped that it will increase credit facilities provided by local banks to the private sector. In Q3 2008, there was $6.3bn in total deposits but only $1.8bn in total loans (a 28% loan to deposit ratio). Mohammed Manasrah, from the Companies Monitoring Department at the PMA, told the Bulletin that effects of the new regulations had already been 2009 while credit facilities increased by $44m during the same period.  Osama Kasbari from the loan-guarantee fund department at CHF explained to the of their local loans. He also expects a rise in the use of the CHF administered Loan Guarantee Facility (LGF). The Loan Guarantee Facility has approved 72 loans since it was set up, totalling $27.5m. Nine loans were approved in February 2009. An additional 34 loans totalling $13.8m are in various stages of processing. The LGF portfolio (net of cancellations) consisted of 62 loans totalling $25.7m. It is estimated that the loans will generate approximately 2,690 new jobs.77% of LGF approved loans are between $10,000 and $200,000. But there is a growing demand for much larger transactions and there are 3 requests for $1m and above in the pipeline. The LGF portfolio is becoming more evenly distributed throughout the West Bank, although Nablus and the other northern governorates still constitute more than 50% of the portfolio. 13% of the portfolio is now in the Ramallah vicinity. Nearly 70% of the loans are distributed to businesses in urban areas. General Manager and the Board of Directors will recommend to the bank™s general assembly on 24 April that it distributes stock dividends to its shareholders. 21 See: http://www.al-ayyam.ps/znews/site/template/article.aspx?did=106706&date=3/11/2009 (Arabic)2 See: http://www.sahem-inv.com/news.php?id=614&month=1 Israeli Arabs will be able to access Nablus, Tulkarm and Jenin by car on Saturdays by the end of April.

According to recent estimates by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) and the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), real GDP (2015 prices) increased by 1.2% during 2019, which GDP per capita decreased by 1.3%.1 Growth in 2019 was driven by a 3.6% growth in Q4 2019 following the release of clearance revenues, otherwise, the economy crisis. Growth in Q4 2019 was mainly the result of an increase in the value added of construction (17%) and services activities (8%).Economic performance in 2019 was better than had been forecasted by both the PMA and PCBS at the beginning of the year with GDP above the baseline projection (Table 1).  In particular, unemployment decreased from 26.8% in 2018 to 26%, even earlier PMA projections of 0.7%.2have been powered by an external shock rather than structural change or resilience within the economy. Among these possible external factors was a 9.3% increase in Palestinians gaining employment in Israel during Q3 20193 compared to Q2 2019 and Q3 2018, reaching 140,800.4Palestinian workers in Israel (with and without permits) are even higher.

Due to the downturn in business activity, rising uncertainty, and closures to combat the pandemic, the livelihoods of many families in Palestine are at risk with tens of thousands of families sinking into poverty. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) recently published the results of a survey it had conducted to assess socio-economic changes and found worrying results.1 The survey examined a sample of 9,926 households, and covered the lockdown period of 5 March - 25 May. For some, the economic situation has improved since then as the government eased pandemic-related movement restrictions. While the spread of the virus has been on a downward trend during October, brief local lockdowns have been required in some areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to slow the rate of infection. The assessment of the Spring 2020 lockdown provides important indicators of the perilous impacts of any possible future generalised lockdowns. Work and incomeAccording to the survey results, the main income earners of 14% of Palestinian households ceased working during the lockdown, while 13% were already unemployed prior to the pandemic. The remainder continued to work, however 54% were absent from work during lockdown (unable to work due to lockdown but still employed). The majority (51%) of those who stopped working were from the industrial sector, while 7% were from the agricultural sector. The results do not specify the percentages for other sectors.As a result of the interruption to work during lockdown, only 23% of main income earners who work as wage employees continued to receive their normal wage, 25% received a reduced wage, and 52% received no wage at all (95% of which were in the private sector). The impact was more severe in the West Bank, with 61% of wage employees not receiving any income, compared to 31% in Gaza, where the spread of COVID-19 - and consequently lockdown measures - was much more limited in that period. Due to the decline in work and wages, 42% of households witnessed their income decrease by half or more during lockdown compared to February/March (46% in the West Bank and 38% in Gaza). Almost two thirds (63%) of households could only cover their expenses for a month or less if the lockdown was renewed, and only 10% could cover their expenses for four months or more. The survey also revealed that 58% of Palestinian households usually borrow money or buy on credit to cover household consumption, including food and other basic expenditure.

Of these, 4 died, 95 people have recovered, and the majority of the remainder are asymptomatic.1 impact on various economic sectors in Palestine. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) expects a $2.5bn (13.5%) decrease in GDP compared to its baseline projection for 2020 assuming that the closures continue until end of May.2 Under this scenario, private and public consumption are expected to decrease by a total of $1.3bn (5.2%), and investment by $2.1bn (43.4%). The PCBS projects that the services sector will be the most affected by the crises, with possible losses of around $1.2bn, followed by the industrial sector ($362), construction ($220m) and agriculture ($200m).The Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) foresees an even larger impact on the economy, using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model that compares two different scenarios.3closure measures would not be fully relaxed before the mid-May, GDP is expected to decline by 20.3%, due to a demand-side shock driven by a decrease in private and public spending (by 21.8% and 15.3% respectively). In the second scenario, which assumes an extension of the closure and gradual recovery for an additional month and a half (until end June), GDP is expected to decline by over 35%, driven by a further decrease in private and public spending (33.2% and 20% respectively). Unemployment is expected to increase from 25% in 20194and to 36.5% in the second. MAS projections also estimate the impact to Gross National Income (GNI) resulting from the loss of income from labour in the Israeli market, forecasting a contraction of at least 25% in GNI.Table 1: Projected Losses due to the COVID-19 crisis, 2020 MASPCBSOrganisationClosure until end of JuneClosure until mid-May Closure until end of MayScenario-35%-20.3%-13.5%Gross Domestic Product-33.2%-21.8%-5.2%Private Spending-20%-15.3%Government Spending-38.1%-26.3%-43.4%Gross Capital Formation (Investment level)-17.2%-1.2%-2%Exports-22.5%-17.2%-7.8%Imports-32.8%-23.9%-Government Revenue-24.6%-17.2%-EmploymentSource: PCBS and MASThe Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), also provided its own estimates on the impact of the current crisis.5the continuation of the closure until the end of June and the second until the end of August. For each scenario, the PMA offers a quarter-by-quarter prediction of the impact of the crisis based on key economic indicators. These estimates are more optimistic than those presented by the PCBS and MAS, largely because they were modeled at an earlier period in the crisis and only focus on major economic aggregates.1 www.corona.ps/2 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_23-4-2020-forc-en.pdf3 MAS Economic Monitor Œ Special Supplement, forthcoming, May 2020, https://bit.ly/2S5mktT 4 https://bit.ly/2ztlpNx5 https://bit.ly/2K9y9uH construction sector might incur if Palestinian workers restrictions on the entry of 65,000 Palestinians working in the Israeli construction sector would lead to delays in the delivery of around 70,000 apartments, which is expected to cause a monthly loss of ILS 4.56 billion ($1.18 billion) in GDP.37As the borders with Jordan and Egypt have been closed for over Palestine is Israel, which has experienced higher transmission rates with 15,782 cases as of 29 April.38 The majority of cases (77%) in the West Bank are among workers returning from Israel,39 with community transmission mostly limited to workers™ families and those who were in direct contact with them.40 The daily overcrowding at crossings and checkpoints, contact with Israeli employers, and daily movement between the West Bank and Israel are all factors that also may be leading to a faster spread of the virus among the workers.41With no control over entry into the West Bank and limited cooperation by Israeli authorities, the GoP is struggling to stop the movement of workers into and out of the West Bank. The Palestinian Ministry of Health deployed testing teams behind Israeli checkpoints, however, systematic tracking has been weak since many workers cross through unmonitored areas.42Workers in Israel are a major source of income for the Palestinian economy, providing subsistence for tens of thousands of families, and stimulating local consumption. 43 The average worker in Israel earns more than double the average wage in the West Bank. In 2019, there were 133,000 Palestinians working in Israel and Israeli settlements, generating $2.55bn in income (15% of GDP).44 ﬁWaqfet Izz™™ FundOn 6 April, the board of the newly founded ﬁWaqfet Izz™™ board, consisting of 30 Palestinian business leaders, began the impact of COVID-19.

On 9 April, the European Union (EU) announced an assistance pandemic.48 The EU welcomed the preventive measures taken so far by the GoP. The assistance package, which also includes humanitarian aid, is a direct response to the GoP™s COVID-19 Response Plan  and commits •49.5m to Healthcare (including six East Jerusalem hospitals), •5.5m to SMEs, •5m to vulnerable communities, and •10,9m for humanitarian aid including UN agencies, UNRWA, and NGOs. On 2 April, the World Bank Group (WBG) approved a new $5m emergency operation to help Palestine address urgent healthcare needs.49 This funding follows a previous reallocation of $800,000 which the World Bank approved on 6 March 2020 as an immediate support to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Other nations have also responded to requests for support. China supplied 10,000 coronavirus testing kits to Palestine, Turkey offered medical assistance to Gaza, and the United States pledged $5m in support.50 March TradingOn 22 March, the Palestine Capital Market Authority (PCMA) suspended trade in Palestine Exchange (PEX), in light of the government™s decision to enforce closure measures.51 On April 21, PCMA decided to resume trading as of 3 May 2020 based on the latest government decision for a gradual lifting of the curfew.52Al-Quds Index witnessed a steady decrease throughout March, falling to 498.9 points (6.6% drop) on the last day of trading.

This amount, which will be paid in 48 equal installments, represents the balance of the NIS 2bn debt which the PNA had accumulated over more than a decade, before the parties reached an agreement in September 2016 to restructure relations between the Government of Israel (GoI) and the PNA with respect to electricity provision and consumption.1Under the terms of the 2016 agreement, which aims to position the PNA as the sole body responsible for electricity distribution across the West Bank, the PNA agreed to pay NIS 500m ($132m) of the debt to the IEC immediately, while another NIS 1bn was agreed to be paid in installments. A remaining balance of NIS 500m was permanently erased from the debt.The May agreement, which is currently pending approval by the IEC Board and Israeli regulators, also sets terms for the sale of power to the PETC over the next 15 years and includes collateral and a guarantee mechanism to ensure that the IEC is paid. The agreement provides for the IEC to supply the PETC with NIS 2.8bn ($775m) worth of power transmission annually, via four high-voltage substations that will be built in Jalama, Nablus, Ramallah and Tarqumiya in the coming years by the IEC and the PNA. This arrangement will enable the PETC to take charge of electricity distribution in the West Bank in line with the 2016 agreement.collecting dues from customers across the West Bank and Gaza. Most Palestinian power distribution companies, municipalities and local councils do not pay the full amount for electricity consumed citing high default rates by consumers or high theft rates as the reason for their inability to fully pay the IEC. To recover part of the debt to the IEC, the GoI has in the past made deductions from the customs duties it collects on behalf of the PNA at Israeli ports.2Palestine currently receives more than 86% of its electricity from Israel, making it the single largest customer of the IEC.  Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Mr. Hussein Al-Sheikh, announced in a written statement that ﬁThe agreement ... frees the Palestinian electricity sector of complete Israeli control, which has lasted for decades.ﬂ 3  Growing Number of Rejected Cheques in PalestineOn 24 April, the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) hosted representatives and experts from the public, private, and legal sectors to discuss 1 https://bit.ly/2JiHLoi2 https://bit.ly/2kwi99p3 https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Israel-to-transfer-much-of-West-Bank-electric-grid-to-Palestinians-553248Main reportsThe Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

The plan, entitled ﬁPeace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli Peopleﬂ (PtP), was announced in two parts.1 The political component was released on 28 January, seven months after the publication of the economic component in June 2019.2 Palestinian political, business and civil society leadership immediately rejected the plan on the grounds that it disregards Palestinian rights to a viable, independent and sovereign state.  sectors.  MAS presented its position paper on the potential implications of the deal, followed by a panel discussion. The economic component of the plan promised $50 billion in new investments over 10 years in Palestine ($28bn), Jordan ($7.5bn), Egypt ($9bn) and Lebanon ($6bn).3 According to the US Administration, successful implementation of the proposed investment plan under PtP would double Palestinian GDP, reduce the unemployment rate to single digits and bring down poverty by half.4 MAS concluded that despite the large sums of promised investment, the Vision poses an existential threat to the viability of the Palestinian economy and constrains the space available for economic activity and investment. Participants highlighted concerns that under the plan Israel will also continue to control all Palestinian water resources (the Dead Sea, Jordan River and groundwater), airspace, cyberspace and trade. Loss of Territory and Resourcesannexation to Israel of the entirety of the Jordan Valley, which is the most fertile 5 It also does not allow for a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem.The concept maps included in the plan suggest that two Palestinian zones would be established in Israeli territory in  the Negev desert near the Gaza Strip; a high-tech manufacturing industrial zone and a residential agricultural zone. These areas would be separated from the Egyptian border by a narrow area controlled by Israel.6Panelists viewed these aspects as a tightening and institutionalising of the restrictions that are currently imposed on the Palestinian economy. Mr Osama Amer, Secretary of the Private Sector Coordinating Council and a speaker on the panel, reiterated ﬁthe political or economic prospects for Palestinians.ﬂ He explained that the Palestinian economy™s potential gains from the proposed plan ($28bn over 10 years) are negligible when compared to economic gains from ending existing restrictions on the Palestinian C™ cost the economy around $3.4bn annually, while recent UNCTAD estimates put PNA 7 12 www.whitehouse.gov/peacetoprosperity/3 https://bit.ly/2JKMXPJ ; https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/middleeast/peace-plan.html4 www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MEP_programsandprojects.pdf5 www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Peace-to-Prosperity-0120.pdf6 https://bit.ly/3d8mB8s; https://politi.co/33mZoe1  7 https://bit.ly/2vsMpLk; https://bit.ly/3dnvPxL'),\n",

This high number illustrates a structural problem in the Palestinian economy which is failing to provide work for highly educated women.In the West Bank the governorates of Tulkarm (28.5%) and Qalqilia (26.0%) had the worst unemployment rates; in Gaza, Rafah had the highest (34.1%).Low labour force participation, at 43.6%, presents another ongoing problem for the labour market and the economy as a whole. Only 39% was recorded in Gaza for Q3. For comparison the rate for both Jordan and Egypt in 2009 was 49%.2 Despite various initiatives documented in previous issues of the Bulletin, women continue to suffer from a disproportionately low participation rate of 16.7% compared to 70.0% for men.3 In Gaza, only 13.2% of women were in the labour force.

This is the second stage of a plan, launched banks to increase their capital from a minimum of $20m to $35m by the end of this year. There are currently 10 local banks and 11 foreign banks operating in the West Bank and 46 in the Gaza Strip. The combined capital of all banks is approximately $900m. All foreign banks, and 26% of local Palestinian banks, of the PMA™s Governor, explained to the Bulletin that if banks are unable to merge with others as part of an effort to rationalise the number of banks™. In a further effort to reduce banking risks the PMA announced, on 12 October, that by the beginning of 2010 it will launch a new computerised older, manual system that blacklisted clients who bounced more than 15 bounced with a value of approximately $250m.2launched in Spring 2010. By the end of November, the PMA expects to contract a German company, ‚Credit Info™, to calculate credit scores for all banking clients in the Palestinian Territory. Scores will be based on information available on the credit registry system, including a client™s record of borrowing, timely payment of bills and loan history.3 The new system will help banks speed up their credit decisions and enable the PMA to keep track of who is taking credit from different banks.

However, the new license allows the company to install a wider network infrastructure that extends coverage and services throughout the entire area (up to 60% of the territory of the West Bank).2 The installation of such infrastructure will result in Israeli providers to offer Palestinian residents in the West Bank more advanced Israeli cellular services for cheaper prices than available through Palestinian networks, creating a ﬁdigital gapﬂ and unfair competition between the Palestinian and Israeli telecommunications sectors.The Government of Israel (GoI) currently limits Palestinian access to the electromagnetic sphere, and controls imports of ICT equipment.3 Granting Bezeq the license to operate fully and legally on Palestinian land, while denying Palestinian telecommunication companies from expanding their networks in Area C, leaves Palestinian residents with no alternatives to Israeli service providers.4 This includes up to 300,000 Palestinians living in those areas, and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who commute through Area C on a daily basis.5 Palestinian telecom companies are prohibited from building switches6 in Area A, which is supposed to be under sole PA control under the Oslo accords.7The Palestinian Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology (MTIT) condemned the GoI™s decision, describing it as a ﬁcontinuation of the occupation of the Palestinian economyﬂ. MTIT added that Israeli operators held 16% of the West Bank market share in 2019, with the number of Palestinian subscribers reaching one million this year.8incurred a consequent revenue loss of around $63m in 2019. Furthermore, Israeli telecommunication companies operate with impunity whilst ignoring the basic mandatory operational legalities such as obtaining licenses and paying fees and taxes to the Palestinian Government. The World Bank estimated that Palestinian telecom companies incurred total revenue losses between $436m and $1.1bn in the period 2013-2015 alone, with the direct impact of the occupation equivalent to 3% of the GDP at the time.9Authority was estimated at between $70m and $184m in the period 2013-2015.Despite such limitations, the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector is among the fastest growing sectors in Palestine. In the last two decades, the ICT sector grew by over 250%, hiring approximately 6,760 workers in 2018. In 2019, it was estimated that the sector contributed $530m to the Palestinian market (3.1% of GDP).101 https://bit.ly/36STcMY 2 www.jpost.com/israel-news/bezeq-operating-license-for-area-c-formalized-after-36-years-646149 3 https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/ict-the-shackled-engine-of-palestines-development/ 4 https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24019/104263.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y 5 https://bit.ly/2V4X4oZ/ https://bit.ly/35UKCOu 6 Devices for making and breaking connection in an electric circuit; it is the heart of any telecommunications 7 https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/ict-the-shackled-engine-of-palestines-development/8 www.maannews.net/news/2021865.html 9 https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24019/104263.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y 10 www.pcbs.gov.ps/statisticsIndicatorsTables.aspx?lang=en&table_id=163 Palestine Economic DashboardGrowthGDP (in million USD) and GDP Per Capita (in USD) in Palestine, Q1 2015 Œ Q1 2020 GDPGDP per capitaQ1 2015Q2 2015Q3 2015Q4 2015Q1 2016Q2 2016Q3 2016Q4 2016Q1 2017Q2 2017Q3 2017Q4 2017Q1 2018Q2 2018Q3 2018Q4 2018Q1 2019Q2 2019Q3 2019Q4 2019Q1 20203300340035003700380036003900400041004200760740780800820840860880900GDP (Q1 2020): $3,820.4m      GDP per capita (Q1 2020): $802Source: PCBSUnemploymentUnemployment and Youth Unemployment in Palestine,  Q1 2015 Œ Q3 2020Youth Unemployment UnemploymentQ1 2015Q2 2015Q3 2015Q4 2015Q1 2016Q2 2016Q3 2016Q4 2016Q1 2017Q2 2017Q3 2017Q4 2017Q1 2018Q2 2018Q3 2018Q4 2018Q1 2019Q2 2019Q3 2019Q4 2019Q1 2020Q2 2020Q3 20202030405060Unemployment rate(Q3 2020): 28.5%           Youth Unemployment rate (Q3 2020): 46.6%Source: PCBSConsumer Price Index (Base year = 2010), January 2015 Œ October 2020 PalestineWest BankGazaJerusalem, J1                                                  Jan-15Mar-15May-15Jul-15Sep-15Nov-15Jan-16Mar-16May-16Jul-16Sep-16Nov-16Jan-17Mar-17May-17Jul-17Sep-17Nov-17Jan-18Mar-18May-18Jul-18Sep-18Nov-18Jan-19Mar-19May-19Jul-19Sep-19Dec-19Jan-20Apr-20May-20Jul-20Sep-20Oct-209095100105110115120Palestine (October  2020): 112.8                                  West Bank (October 2020): 117.9Gaza (October  2020): 102.3           Source: PCBSTradeQ1 2015 Œ Q1 2020 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Q1 2015Q2 2015Q3 2015Q4 2015Q1 2016Q2 2016Q3 2016Q4 2016Q1 2017Q2 2017Q3 2017Q4 2017Q1 2018Q3 2018Q4 2018Q1 2019Q2 2019Q3 2019Q4 2019Q1 2020Q2 2018Imports (Q1 2020): $1,296.7m                               Exports (Q1 2020): $230.6mBusiness Cycle IndexPalestine Monetary Authority Business Cycle Index, January 2015 ŒOctober 2020 PalestineWest BankGazaJan - 15Apr - 15Jul - 15Oct - 15Jan - 16Apr - 16Jul - 16Oct - 16Jan - 17Apr - 17Jul - 17Oct - 17Jan - 18Apr - 18Jul - 18Oct - 18Jan - 19Apr - 19Jul - 19Oct - 19Dec-19Jan - 20Apr - 20Jun - 20Jul - 20Aug-20Oct - 20-80-60-40-2002040Palestine  (October 2020): -29.8                         West Bank (October 2020): -26.4Gaza (October 2020): -37.9          Source: PMABanking SectorUSD), Q1 2015 Œ Q3 2020 Total Deposits TotQ1 2015Q2 2015Q3 2015Q4 2015Q1 2016Q2 2016Q3 2016Q4 2016Q1 2017Q2 2017Q3 2017Q4 2017Q1 2018Q2 2018Q3 2018Q4 2018Q1 2019Q2 2019Q3 2019Q4 2019Q1 2020Q2 2020Q3 2020400060008000100001200014000Total Credit (Q3 2020): $9,894m             Total Deposits (Q3 2020): $14,061.9mSource: PMA'),\n",

The Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Israeli Government agreed in May 2008 that Israel would release the necessary frequencies for Wataniya Mobile operations and services. The Quartet Representative said at the time, ﬁthe Government of Israel  has agreed to [–] release a frequency of 2.4 MHz in the 900 bandwidth. The Government of Israel will commit, in writing, that within 6 to 8 months, the assignment of frequency will be amended to a total bandwidth of 4.8 MHz at the 900/1800 MHz bands and will assign a frequency of more than 4.8 MHz in due course, 1 To date the necessary frequencies have not been released.Wataniya Mobile planned to launch their mobile service provision in April 2009. Allan Richardson, CEO of Wataniya Mobile said that Wataniya has been unable to launch its operations because Israel had not abided by the frequency agreement. He added that some of the company™s essential equipment remains held up at Israeli Customs.The Palestinian Minister of Telecommunications and Information Technology (MTIT), Dr. Mashhour Abu Daka, told the Bulletin that Israel is pushing Jawwal and Wataniya to use a 1,800MH frequency and abandon the 900MH frequency. However, 900MH is more cost effective and has a wider coverage area than 1,800MH. This range requires fewer materials for installation (towers, cables etc.) and incurs fewer overall costs. Telecommunications companies on the whole prefer 900MH for 3G services. If Wataniya does secure a frequency and Jawwal also shifts to using 1800MH, the Israeli telecommunications companies, still operating at 900MH, will be able to offer more affordable and better services. ‚Israel is acting in a way that is contrary to supporting an open market economy, working to strengthen the competitive advantage of the Israeli telecommunications companies as two new regional companies enter the Palestinian market™, Abu Daka added.The withdrawal of Wataniya would put the PA in a critical situation. It could lose $354m which was paid by Wataniya Mobile for license fees, and another $200m in expenses spent on installing equipment and running costs. 3,000 jobs would be lost.2 The international community is continuing to put pressure on Israel to facilitate Palestinian telecommunications sector expansion,3 and the release of frequences and equipment.1 See: l 2 See: http://www.9 3 See: http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE55F3RR20090616 The joint Palestinian-Israeli economic committee is expected to reconvene before the end of July, after years of inaction.

Amr Hamd, Gaza General Manager of the Palestinian Federation of Industries, explained that the lack of liquidity in the banks in Gaza is prohibiting companies from meeting commercial agreements. Cash is not available in the banks and the vast majority of businessmen cannot leave Gaza or transfer money to or from Israel or the West Bank. Money transfers from banks in Gaza to Israel require special permission which is almost impossible to attain. Hamd said that around NIS 50m passes into the Gaza Strip every month or so. The Bank of Palestine told the Bulletin that an individual can bring up to $10,000 cash into Gaza. However, since only a handful of businessmen are able to travel in and out of Gaza, this does not amount to much. According to the Bank of Palestine and Arab Bank, there are no pre-set daily limits for withdrawals. Private and public sector salaries in Gaza are paid in Israeli shekels (NIS), (about two thirds of the total employed in Gaza), while UNRWA and foreign institutions pay salaries in US$. Jordanian Dinars (JD) are also used but to a lesser extent. However this month US$ and JD are in greater demand than NIS. Hamd suggested this may be largely related to UNRWA, which brings in and distributes most of the US$ in Gaza, through employee salaries, cash assistance for its job creation programme and the remaining damage costs for refugees affected by the recent hostilities. This month UNWRA has not brought as many dollars into Gaza as it has done in the past. Shokri Karaz, Branch Manager of Arab Bank in Gaza, told the Bulletin that the lack of dollars and JD in Gaza™s banks is greatly impacting spending patterns, affecting building projects and wedding plans alike. Karaz explained that when cash is available, customers tend to take out as much future of the banks.The almost total closure of Gaza™s borders and the liquidity crisis are affecting exchange rates.

This includes the expansion of Israeli settlements and outposts in the West Bank, developing infrastructure to connect the settlements to Israel, restrictions on Palestinian construction and demolitions in Area C under Israeli military control.5 The move under discussion would deepen the existing reality on the ground and provide a legal framework for it, making it ﬁde jure annexationﬂ.6economically viable Palestinian State.

This includes the entire Jordan valley (except for an enclave around Jericho) and the Dead Sea in the eastern part of the West Bank, land located between the Israeli Separation Wall and the Green Line (armistice line of 1949), and the Jewish enclaves in the corridors area between east and west of the West Bank.Under the terms of the plan Israel could annex around 1,812 km2 (32%) of the West Bank land area (5,661 km2), while sixteen Israeli settlements with 15,675 settlers 1 https://wapo.st/3fx1rRT 2 https://bit.ly/2Buqm9W 3 https://bit.ly/2ULL3oj 4 https://bit.ly/3hv4ls1 5 https://indd.adobe.com/view/acfbc290-e96b-44f9-8617-58052a785c686 https://bit.ly/2N2401P 7 https://bit.ly/2UHpdCw 8 www.whitehouse.gov/peacetoprosperity/Following the announcement, Hussein al-Sheikh, head of the Palestinian Civil Affairs Authority, stated that the PNA refused to accept the transfer of May clearance revenues from Israel, as it is absolved of all agreements and understandings with the Government of Israel.34  The clearance revenues account for approximately $208m per month and over 60% of tax revenues.35 As a result, the PNA has been unable to pay salaries from May 2020.36 The PNA has begun implementing budget cuts that include cutting salaries of tens of thousands contributes towards salaries, medical expenses, and utility fees.37 By the end of June, there was still no word as to whether the Government would be able to cover public sector salaries for May, which usually are paid in On 9 June, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh announced that the PNA had submitted a Quartet38, that provides for the creation of a sovereign, independent, and demilitarised Palestinian state, along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as the capital. He suggestions to resume contact in order to transfer clearance revenues, noting that Israel could transfer the funds without direct contact.39The PNA also expressed its stance to international donor partners through a statement to the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC). The statement stated that annexation would violate Palestinians™ basic rights, deprive them of sovereignty over their natural resources, undermine the territorial unity of the Palestinian territories, and cause detriment to the two-state solution. The PNA called upon all States to recognise the State of Palestine with pre-1967 borders, adopt measures of accountability (such as sanctions), and work towards ending the Israeli occupation of areas occupied since 1967.40On 21 June, Hussein al-Sheikh told Israel™s public radio Kan that the PNA and Palestinian security forces will collapse if Israel proceeds with its annexation plan.4134 http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=37R4Uca117299750238a37R4Uc35 https://wapo.st/2YALva4 36 https://bit.ly/30VFIPv 37 https://nyti.ms/311GWsz 38 consists of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia, with a mandate to assist in mediating Middle East peace negotiations while supporting Palestinian economic development and institution building39 https://bit.ly/2CaNLxt 40 www.lacs.ps/documentsShow.aspx?ATT_ID=4526441 www.al-ayyam.ps/ar_page.php?id=13f99938y335124792Y13f99938  International ResponseInternational responses to potential annexation have been largely critical, with most nations and organisations denouncing the decision and urging that it be reconsidered.

According to the IMF, the economic outlook for the West Bank and Gaza for the remainder of 2015 is challenging and subject to considerable risks. Assuming there is no change in restrictions and/or security conditions, the IMF projects growth in the West Bank to slow to 1.8% by year end, from 5% in 2014. According to the IMF, the expected drop reßects the impact of increased uncertainty on private demand and reduced growth in Israel. In Gaza, a rebound of 6.5% is expected, assuming continued reconstruction activity. Real GDP growth for the Palestinian economy is therefore projected at 2.9%, implying stagnant per capita GDP given the high rate of population growth. Inßation is projected to remain low, at less than 2%. The main risks to the outlook relate to heightened political and security tensions and a related lower than expected rebound in private investment and Þscal slippages. The latter include revenue shortfalls, lower donor aid, and the inability of the PNA to withstand spending pressures.The IMF estimates that in the medium term, absent a political breakthrough, growth will remain below what is needed to durably reduce unemployment and improve living standards (Figure 1). Under a baseline scenario assuming political status quo and unchanged Israeli restrictions, some decline in aid after the completion of Gaza reconstruction, and limited policy actions on the part of the PNA, growth is expected to hover around 3%, with a rise in unemployment. A further deterioration in the political landscape or aid shortfalls would produce even worse economic outcomes. On the other hand, the IMF points out that even in the absence of a political breakthrough, improvements in Israeli-Palestinian economic cooperation could prove beneÞcial.Figure 1: GDP growth and projections (2012 - 2020)-15-10-5051015West BankGaza StripPalestine201220132014201520162017201820192020Source: IMF1 www.ldf.ps/documentsShow.aspx?ATT_ID=219792 www.imf.org/external/country/WBG/RR/2015/092115.pdfIn September, the new Palestinian city of Rawabi welcomed its Þrst residents, 2,000 people are expected to live there by the end of yearBetween 14 and 16 September, Þve leading Palestinian companies from the stone and marble sector participated at ‚The Big 5 Kuwait™, the country™s largest international construction eventThe Current Account deÞcit (totaling $372.7m in Q2 2015) increased by 15.2% compared to the previous quarterA recent report by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development suggests that that Gaza ﬁcould become uninhabitable by 2020 due to ongoing de-development, eight years of economic blockade and three military operations in the past six yearsﬂThe Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

Two decades of instability have resulted in a pattern of declining GDP per capita, high unemployment and continued deterioration of Gaza™s historically strong productive sectors. The energies of government and business must be directed towards sustainable development, with the private sector at its heart. Creating a longer-term vision for a stable, connected and thriving Gaza can help guide shorter-term interventions.

The decrease was mainly driven by a loss of 20,500 jobs in Gaza and 11,200 jobs in Israel and Israeli settlements during the same period. The labour force participation rate for Palestine remained relatively unchanged in Q2 2017 (45.4%) when compared to Q1 2017 (45.8%) and Q2 2016 (45.7%). The major difference between the female participation rate (particularly low at 18.5%) and the male participation rate (71.6%) persisted. The wide gap in unemployment by gender also remained, as female unemployment reached 50%, compared to 23.7% for males. The situation was more pronounced in Gaza, where female unemployment amounted to 71.5%, compared to 36.2% for males. In the West Bank, the unemployment rate for females was 36.2%, compared to 16.8% for males.Another persistent trend is youth unemployment, with 46.3% of those aged 20-24 years and 39.2% of those aged 25-29 years unemployed in Q2 2017. Among female youth, the unemployment rate reached 72.7% for those aged 20-24 years and 69.1% for those aged 25-29 years. The most educated Palestinian women (13+ years of schooling) also face a high unemployment rate at 57.4%, despite exhibiting a relatively high labour force participation rate (46.7%). This is a particularly worrisome trend as it could discourage women from pursuing higher education.1 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_7-8-2017-LF-en.pdf  The Palestine Monetary Authority Business Cycle Index (PMABCI) deteriorated to -4.3 points in August 2017, from 0.3 points in the previous monthAccording to data recently released by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in goods reached $1,034m in Q2 2017, an increase of 1.6% from Q1 2017The Palestine Investment Fund (PIF) announced on 30 August 2017, the commencement of the construction of the Al-Nuaima Solar Power Station in the Jericho and Jordan Valley GovernorateAppMahal, a Palestinian mobile application developer, completed a $4m Series B Fund Management Company The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

This tension has been compounded by the lack of agreed communication channels on economic issues between the two sides. Under the Paris Economic Protocol signed in 1994, a Palestinian-Israeli Joint Economic Committee (JEC) was established to follow up the implementation of the agreement and to arbitrate issues related to the economy.2 However, the Committee has been inactive since the early 2000s despite some attempts to reactivate it.3 The recent partial resolution of the 2019 clearance revenue dispute between the PNA and Israel was supposed to include the reconvening of some technical committees within the JEC framework and a reconsideration of the Paris Protocol, but no progress has since been announced on these issues.Halting Import of Calves from IsraelOn 28 October, Riyad Atari, the Palestinian Minister of Agriculture, announced that the Israeli authorities had approved the import of 10,700 calves to Palestine from abroad, through Palestinian traders. He stated that 1,680 calves will be imported in the next few days, and the remainder gradually introduced into the market in batches until mid-November.4Palestine imports around 120,000 calves from Israel annually; 20,000 from Israeli farms, and 100,000 from Israeli traders importing from abroad.5 On 16 September, Atari announced the Government™s plan to halt all calf imports from Israel or from Israeli importers, and he called upon all regulatory bodies to follow up on implementation.6 The Government™s announcement came as part of its wider economic disengagement policy, whereby Palestinians would be able to import calves directly from abroad through Palestinian traders rather than through Israeli importers or from Israeli farms.However, the GoI has meanwhile threatened to halt the entry of Palestinian agricultural products (approximately 280-300 tons per day) into the Israeli market if a ﬁboycottﬂ of livestock imports from Israel is pursued.7 The Palestinian Government has since sources of imports.8 Palestinian traders have informed the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture that the Gol and the Israeli veterinary department have held up clearance health standards, which will result in a 25-day delay to complete necessary health checks.9 The GoI also rescinded Businessman Cards (BMCs)10 of Palestinian direct 1 http://palestinecabinet.gov.ps/Website/AR/ViewDetails?ID=437252 www.paltrade.org/upload/agreements/Paris%20Economic%20Protocol.pdf3 https://bit.ly/2rVbpZy 4 www.alhadath.ps/article/108478/5 www.alhadath.ps/article/108478/ 6 www.palestineeconomy.ps/ar/Article/154827 www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-israel-palestinian-authority-economy-boycott-1.79912568 https://bit.ly/32gFgIC9 quarantine is usually 8 days; https://bit.ly/35i7lRD 10 A magnetic permit that allows a limited number of Palestinian business executives to move between the Palestinian Territories and Israel.

       "  'The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 120September 2016World Bank and IMF Reports to the AHLCPolitical and security uncertainties limit the prospects for economic growth in Palestine in 2016, according to recent reports by the World Bank and the IMF to the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC).1 According to the documents, the Palestinian economic outlook is worrying in the context of a stalled peace process. The two institutions project medium-term growth in real GDP income given the projected population growth. Once again, the World Bank and the IMF stressed the need for revived efforts by all relevant parties (the Palestinian National Authority Œ PNA, the Government of Israel Œ GoI and international donors) to reduce the pressure on the PNA™s budget, to support the reconstruction of Gaza and to renew the peace process.According to the World Bank, ﬁPolitical instability and the long lasting restrictions on movement, access and trade are the main impediments to economic growthﬂ in resulted in the ﬁdeindustrializationﬂ of the Palestinian economy - with the share of manufacturing in GDP dropping from 18% in 1995 to around 10% in 2015. The share of agriculture in the economy has also decreased to 50% of what it was in 1995. The World Bank also states that whilst the Palestinian economy will not be able to reach its potential until a permanent peace agreement has been established, there is much that can be done. One of the key constraints to economic growth continues to be Israeli restrictions on Palestinian access to Area C.  A 2014 World Bank study suggested that unrestricted Palestinian economic activity in Area C, including the exploitation of its natural resources, could increase GDP by as much as 35% and create thousands of jobs, primarily through growth in the agricultural sector and Dead Sea minerals processing industries.2 The importance of Area C for economic development was emphasized by the members of the AHLC during a recent meeting in New York. The AHLC also stressed that further reforms by the Palestinian Government are required to improve the economic conditions, with particular attention to competitiveness and the business climate.According to the World Bank, reforms to improve the business climate could also help support the Palestinian economy, with efforts needed on four priority areas. First, there is a need to reform the current legislation governing business, as it currently is a mixture of Ottoman, British Mandate, Jordanian, Egyptian and Palestinian laws, in addition to Israeli Military Orders. This has created many internal inconsistencies in the rules governing business activity in Palestine. Adoption by the PNA of pending legislation, including the Competition Law and the 1 http://bit.ly/2d9BWHM and http://bit.ly/2deWuix2 http://bit.ly/2d9D8upOn 13 September, the PNA and the GoI signed an agreement to resolve the payment of the accumulated debt of the PNA to the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) and to restructure the relation between the GoI and the PNA with respect to electricity provision and consumptionOn 31 August, under the auspices of Prime Minister Dr. Rami Hamdallah, the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) held its Economic Conference 2016 under the theme ﬁTowards a New Vision for the Revival of the Palestinian EconomyﬂThe Government has maintained a stable level of current expenditure by decreasing its expenditure on employees™ compensation, according to the recently published Financial Statement for General GovernmentPEX announced that the listed companies increased by reaching $163m compared to $139m during the same period in 2015The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

The Statement indicates that the increase has been mainly assets (especially by local government). The Government has managed to maintain a stable level of current expenditure by decreasing its expenditure on employees™ compensation (around a 9% drop in absolute terms between 2014 and 2015). This decrease could be attributed to the PNA™s active effort to stabilize the wage bill. Despite an increase in revenue received from taxation, (mainly aid to the central government) resulted in general government revenue falling by 7.5% from 2014 to $4,110m in 2015. PCBS data on taxation between 2010 and 2015 shows that the absolute value of collected taxes increased collection by central government. As a result of the decrease in revenues from 2014 and the lack of substantial change in current expenses, the net operating balance (revenues minus current expenses) of the general government dropped from $342m in 2014 to only $12m in 2015. half of 2016 (available in the latest World Bank report to the AHLC) suggests that while the PNA could align its spending and revenue capacity in the medium to long term, in the short term there remains an urgent need for projected for 2016.August TradingIn August, the Al-Quds index decreased by 0.72% from the previous month, reaching 507.8 points on the last day of trading.5 A total of 29.8m shares worth $49.4m were traded during the month, marking an increase from July 2016 of 105% and 82.4% in the number and value of traded shares, respectively.

The challenging conditions derived from the long term restrictions imposed on Gaza by the government of Israel have led to structural economic stagnation and a continuous deterioration of the living standards. As reported by UNRWA, the number of Palestinian refugees relying on food aid has increased from less than 80,000 in 2000 to over 830,000 today. The grave humanitarian consequences following the recent escalation in Gaza are likely to further deteriorate food security standards and have long-lasting impact on its population.  EntrepreneurshipThe fourth Startup Weekend Gaza (SWG) took place on 19-21 June.15 Despite the relatively small start-up scene in Gaza, 150 companies were selected to participate in the hands-on web and mobile technology event from among 650 applicants, marking the largest-to-date event of its kind in Gaza.16 As such, SWG demonstrates the existence of a young, vibrant community committed to working for a better living through innovation and creative thinking.  In Gaza, women and youth are taking the lead in the entrepreneurship scene. This phenomenon could result in tangible improvements for such marginalised population segments if conditions for the sustainable development of the sector are promoted. More than half of SWG participants were female and the youngest participants were 14 and 16 years old. 15 www.gaza.startupweekend.org/16 www.wamda.com/2014/06/startup-weekend-gaza-4-turning-point-ecosystem',\n",

Formed of independent technocrats, the new government is tasked with the mission of preparing for national elections (intended to be held within the next six months) and integrating West Bank and Gaza institutions, following seven years of internal political division. Four of the newly appointed government ministers are residents from Gaza. Dr Rami Hamdallah, an academic and university president, was re-appointed as Prime Minister of the new technocratic government, after having served as the Prime Minister of the PNA since June 2013. Of the 16 ministers under him about half were members of the previous PNA government, including Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, Dr Mohammad Mustafa, who has also been appointed as the new government´s Minister of National Economy. Dr Mustafa is also currently the Chairman of the Palestine Investment Fund (PIF), which he joined as CEO in 2005. Shukri Bishara, who has served as the PNA Minister of Finance since mid-2013, will be responsible for both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning under the new government. With extensive private sector experience, Mr Bishara served as CEO of the Housing Bank for Trade & Finance, and held several positions at the Arab Bank between 1979 and 2006, when he was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of the PIF.School to Work TransitionThe Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics announced the main results of the Youth Transition from School to Work Survey 2013, conducted in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO). The survey, part of ILO™s Work4Youth Project, was carried out in 28 countries around the world.Findings indicate that the majority of Palestinian youth struggle to successfully which the ILO argues is one of the main causes of long-term unemployment.1Survey results show that in 2013 only 23% of young Palestinians completed their transition from education to stable or satisfactory employment. At the same time, nearly half of young graduates had not started their transition, and around 32% remained ﬁin transitionﬂ. The education-to-employment transitional period was stable job after the completion of studies. The survey also suggests that the opportunities available in the Palestinian labour market require relatively low skill levels. Consequently, better educated data shows that the highest youth unemployment rates were registered among (75.4% in total Œ 67.1% among males and 83.5% among females).1 www.bit.ly/UTCff5The results of the Youth Transition from School to Work Survey indicate that the majority of Palestinian youth struggle to successfully move from education to employmentIn mid-May the Bank of Israel banned Palestinian commercial banks from making deposits of shekels in Israeli banksThe US Senate approved a $48.3bn State and Foreign Operations bill that included cuts in total aid funding to PalestineThe IFC announced an investment of up to $3m in the Palestine Growth Capital Fund, a Palestinian private equity fundForum discussed the challenges facing the water sector, focusing on the water and energy nexus and the role of the private sectorThe Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

As the Bulletin went to print, Gisha reported that Israel had ordered further restrictions on movement at Gaza™s crossings.18 There is an urgent need to enable major construction projects in Gaza, as the sector contributes roughly a quarter of Gaza™s GDP and remains an important source of employment for Gazan workers. The recent sharp rise in total unemployment in Gaza (which reached 41% in Q1 2014, up from 31% in Q1 2013) was largely driven by a loss of around 12,500 jobs in the construction sector. As a result, construction™s share of total employment in Gaza decreased from 6.9% in Q1 2013 to 2.2% in Q1 2014.19May PEX TradingDuring most of May the Al-Quds index continued its downward trend, although it partially recovered towards the end of the month.

Of the total, only 42 licenses (0.02%) were issued for construction in Gaza.Construction activities in Gaza remain severely affected by the long-standing restrictions on the entrance of construction materials from Israel and Egypt. The closure of most trade tunnels between Gaza and Egypt between 2012 and 2013 left the Karm Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing, connecting Gaza to Israel, as the main passage for the transfer of goods into and out of the Strip. Since the last quarter of 2013 restrictions on the entrance of several construction projects have been frozen as a result of the shortage. There are currently only 81 active projects in Gaza, all of them funded either by Qatar or international organisations (in addition to 27 UNRWA projects).16June 2014 Israel permitted the entrance of construction materials for a number of projects implemented by the UN, after having banned the passage of all construction materials, whether for international organisations or the private sector, from October 2013.17 As of 16 June other construction materials were reported to be entering in 15 www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_PCBS/Downloads/book2054.pdf16 www.gisha.org/en-blog/2014/06/12/building-in-ruins/17 www.gisha.org/UserFiles/File/publications/Info_Gaza_Eng.pdf',\n",

Of the total traded from Gaza in May, 61 truckloads were exports to Israel (39) and other international markets (22), while the rest was marketed in the West Bank.1 The increase comes as a result of some relaxation on restrictions to the exit of goods from Gaza by the Government of Israel (GoI), which since November 2014 has allowed the sale of certain Gaza-made products in the West Bank. More recently, from March 2015, the GoI has allowed the entry of agricultural products from Gaza into Israel, following a complete ban since 2007. Between 8 March and 11 June (latest available data), 102 truckloads of tomatoes and eggplants (equalling almost 1,400 tons) were exported from Gaza to Israel.2While increased trade from Gaza is undoubtedly a positive development, recent allowed out of Gaza is only a negligible portion of the trade level observed prior to the blockade.    Data from UNOCHA (Figure 1) shows that exports from Gaza dropped from 15,255 truckloads in 2000 to as little as 136 truckloads in 2014.3 A sharp decrease was immediately observed after the beginning of the blockade, with merely 33 truckloads of goods leaving Gaza in 2008.

More than 20 exhibitors raised awareness around the importance of preserving the environment, promoting greater energy independence in Palestine, and rationalizing consumption. Dr. Omar Kitaneh, chairman of the PNA Energy and Natural Resources Authority, addressed the conference, stressing the strategic importance of renewable energy for Palestine™s development and the government™s commitment to enabling investment in the sector. With over 60 companies working on renewable energy, 40 of which are organised under the Palestinian Federation of Renewable Energy Industries, the sector is gaining momentum. Following long-standing blocks to the development of projects due to regulatory gaps, it is expected that the Cabinet approval of a draft Renewable Energy Law in May 2015 will unlock investment and job creation opportunities. 11 www.facebook.com/IGEE.Expo?fref=photo',\n",

The West Bank´s GDP increased by almost 2% from Q1 2014, although this was mainly motivated by rises in the net collection of VAT on imports (23%) and custom duties (27%). Enhanced tax collection partly compensated real drops in the value added by important economic activities, including construction (-8%) and manufacturing (-10%). Poor economic performance in the West Bank during Q1 2015 is likely to be related to decreased consumption due to the inability of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to pay public workers´ salaries in full during January and February, after the Government of Israel (GoI) temporarily suspended the transfer of clearance revenues.Most economic sectors contracted at the country level in Q1 2015 with respect to the previous year (Table 1).

This, according to PIBF, could boost GDP from $12bn to $44bn in ten years. PIBF™s research estimates that the FTA would enable double-digit growth The research suggests that export-driven growth could be centred on high potential economic sectors, most notably the manufacturing industry, agriculture and tourism (all of which have experienced poor growth under the status quo). Opportunities for these and other sectors are deemed greater in the Pan-Arab market, which is expected to become the main destination for Palestinian exports, alongside Israel.Korean Support for Tech Start-upsIn June the Korea International Cooperation Agency signed agreements with the PNA Ministry of Planning and Administrative Development and the PNA Ministry of Telecommunication and Information Technology to support Palestinian IT start-ups with $7m in grants, to be disbursed under the Palestine Start-Up Support (PASS) programme.11 The PASS aims to activate the start-up ecosystem in both the West Bank and Gaza by improving the investment environment, intensifying an acceleration programme and fostering greater collaboration between universities and the business sector.

The saving will depend on the price that customers were paying previously.the cost of these reforms. This will gradually be withdrawn over four years to incentivise improved performance from the electricity companies, including increasing the rate of payment collection which has historically been low. The price reduction will help bring down the proportion of household income spent on electricity which, at 10%, is one of the highest in the region.2The scheme categorises households based on their monthly consumption: below 100 kWh, 101-200 kWh, and above 200 kWh. Households with a lower monthly consumption, typically poorer households, will pay lower prices per kWh. The price of electricity with regular or prepaid meters will be the same per kWh, but regular meters will require a monthly subscription of NIS 10. The price of electricity for commercial purposes (retail businesses for example) will decline by 2-22%.  Industrial enterprises will pay 22-36% less, the price of electricity used in agriculture will drop by 27-37% and in water pumping by 20-24%.The new system will treat the Jordan River Valley region in a special manner to emphasise the importance of the area in agrarian and industrial development. Households and industries in the valley will pay NIS 0.05-0.20 less per kWh than in other areas, which will mean a price reduction of nearly 40% for the region.The most recent energy survey, released in June by the Palestinian Central Bureau for Statistics (PCBS), shows that nearly all Palestinian households (99.8%) are now connected to the public electricity network.3 Between January 2010 and January 2011, average household consumption of electricity grew by 4.72%, reaching 266 kWh in the current year.

In 2012 around 10% of the Palestinian population aged 18-64 had been involved in starting or running a business at some stage during the previous 42 months. Overall, as many as 273,000 entrepreneurs were active in Palestine in 2012. In this same year, entrepreneurship activity rates in other MENA economies such as Egypt and Algeria were of 8.8% and 7.8%, respectively. Despite high entrepreneurial activity rates (and in line with global trends2), a major gender gap exists among entrepreneurs in Palestine. In 2012 the early-stage entrepreneurship rate for males in the West Bank was 16%, four times the 4% ratio registered among women. This represents a widening of the gender gap observed in 2010, when 18% of men and 10% of women were considered to be entrepreneurs. In Gaza, the entrepreneurship gender gap increased from about 5% in 2010 (when the male rate was around 6% and that of females was below 1%) to nearly 14% in 2012 (when the male rate rose to 16% and the female ratio reached 2%).While the middle-aged population (25-44) is typically the most likely to participate in entrepreneurial activities, their engagement has decreased over the last 3 years. At the same time, the participation of the youngest adult population segment (18-24) increased. This trend is regarded by MAS as a very positive development since youth entrepreneurship is considered to be one of the main driving forces of any economy: young entrepreneurs contribute enthusiasm, motivation and innovation. The report also shows that the average Palestinian entrepreneur is well-educated, as there is a high positive correlation between entrepreneurial activity rates and Palestine was prepared), early-stage entrepreneurship has become slightly more equally distributed among individuals with different educational levels. Income levels also appear to be among the main determinants of entrepreneurship. Individuals with higher household income are more likely to start entrepreneurial are motivated by opportunity (58%) rather than by necessity (42%).Finally, the report also shows that entrepreneurship also plays a crucial role in terms of employment generation. As estimated by MAS, in 2012 762,900 jobs were directly related to the development of entrepreneurial activities, accounting for as much as 77% of the Palestinian labour force. More than 273,000 of those employed were entrepreneurs themselves (owners and managers of small companies) and 1 www.mas.ps/2012/Publications2 www.gemconsortium.org/docs/download/2645In Q1 2013 Palestinian real GDP decreased by 5.1% with respect to the previous quarter and was 2.7% higher than in Q1 2012.During July the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry launched the Palestine Business Council for Dubai and Northern Emirates.On 26 June the PA Ministry of National Economy and the Union of Palestinian Chambers of Commerce Chamber Information System.™The Palestinian Monetary Authority Business Cycle Indicator experienced a major drop in June.In June 2013 the overall consumer price index slightly increased with respect to the previous month.The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

The rise in unemployment in Gaza was mostly driven by an absolute loss of around 12,500 jobs in the construction sector, greatly affected by the destruction of trading tunnels with Egypt and the long-standing restrictions on imports of construction materials from Israel. As a result, construction™s share of total employment in Gaza decreased from 6.9% in Q1 2013 to 2.2% in Q1 2014. At the same time, in the West Bank more than 29,000 jobs were added in commerce, hotels and restaurants, and around 20,000 new positions were created in construction activities between Q1 2013 and Q1 2014.Total unemployment in Q1 2014 was higher among women (36.5%) than among male workers (23.3%). The increase in total unemployment was partly explained by a rise in total labour force participation (LFP). As more workers entered the labour market, LFP reached 46.3% in Q1 2014, up from 43.4% in Q1 2013. LFP increased the most among Gazan women on a year-to-year basis (+5.1 percentage points), making female LFP in Gaza (20.5%) higher than in the West Bank (19.8%). However, female LFP continues to be low at an aggregate level, reaching 17.3% (against 69.3% among men). This is a common feature of several countries in the region, as LFP rates among Syrian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Lebanese women are equally low (ranging between 13-24%). Cultural reasons seem to be the main underlying factor keeping women out of the labour market, as almost 70% of Palestinian women who were not looking for a job in 2013 carried out housework. Annual data for 2013 shows that total unemployment, at 23.4%, reached its highest level since 2010. Following a long-term trend, the total unemployment rate was much higher in Gaza (32.6%) than in the West Bank (18.6%).

This is a market we should encourage, since they are mainly coming to our side. What about the quality of tourism services? Do you see a Most hotels have historically been training their own employees. They bring workers from anywhere and simply get them to work. That is already done, but we should not continue on that basis. This is why our current project to create a hospitality school in Jericho is so important, as it will allow us to improve the quality of the offerings and professionalise services. We see that people are willing to stay in Palestine, but they obviously expect a professional service.Can you tell us more about the school project? It is a joint venture between the hotel association and the tour operator association, which I preside. It is purely will include the PA Ministry of Education and Ministry the curricula, for graduates to be acknowledged and have priority when looking for a job. Seed money for the investment came from American donors and we are now hoping that the Japanese will engage as well. Although we expect to raise around 60% of total investment from donor funding, the school will operate as a hotel too, since we need to ensure the commercial sustainability of the project. We should not depend on donations for the rest of our lives, but survive and stand on our own. I am very optimistic about the future of tourism in Palestine, even without peace. Of course that if we had peace it would be the best thing that ever happened to us. But even under the conditions in which we are living now we see a modest (although continuous) increase in the level of activity. Tourism is the only industry that is really viable as far as I am concerned; it is our petroleum, and something we have to protect. I believe that in the mid to long term it could constitute up to 30% of GDP.making a mistake is that they are competing with each other rather than working to improve income per hotel. Whenever tourists are visiting the Holy Land, Israel and Palestine, we need to make programmes in which they stay overnight in Jericho, Bethlehem and East Jerusalem. But it is not the quantity that we are after at the end of the day, but the quality. We are limited in the numbers of visitors we can absorb: how many people can visit the Church of the Nativity? How many people can walk in the Old City of Jerusalem? We have to be careful. It is not a mass production industry. The focus should be on providing a better service and getting a higher income for that. We need to develop ´boutique´ or ´niche´ tourism for the time being. What particular tourist segments are you thinking about for the development of niche tourism?Now our business is basically depending on religious tourists. This has been good, and we should protect it. However, to increase our numbers dramatically, we should go into cultural trips and approach large companies in markets with high potential. Another sector that could be important for us is the Diaspora. And to attract them we have to create events. We are happy to see that the Ramallah Club from North America will be having their annual meeting in Ramallah this summer. Another particularly promising market for Diaspora tourists is in South America, where there are many Palestinians from Bethlehem, Beit Sahour and Beit Jala. pilgrimage destinations, such as Lourdes in France or Fatima in Portugal? It is! And that is really a shame! I think that the detrimental part is related to the political issue. And we are talking about just one segment here, the Christians, but how about the Muslims coming to Palestine? If tourists from the Arab world were allowed to come into Israel they would swamp the place. It is the third holiest site for Islam. Muslim pilgrimage is not complete without coming to Jerusalem. Of course for political reasons Israel is not opening the door for this market. However, there are ',\n",

Real GDP growth reached 5.9% last year, down from an average rate of almost 11% in 2010-2011.3 The World Bank attributes the slowdown to the absence of easing In particular, the organisation stresses that the continuation of restrictions and the absence of real opportunities to open up the Palestinian economy are major obstacles to allow private sector-led growth.High and persistent unemployment (especially among youth) continues to pose a major challenge to the Palestinian Economy, characterised by low labour force participation rates, high unemployment duration and the concentration of workers Bank these factors prevent many Palestinians of working age from developing on-the-job skills, which are much needed to enhance local competitiveness in the global economy.As a result of the current situation, the IMF™s growth forecasts (shown in table 1 below) have deteriorated with respect to their September 2012 assessment. The baseline assumes a continued deadlocked peace process, falling donor aid as a per cent of GDP and no progress in phasing out the Israeli restrictions on lower donor support and even slower progress on structural reforms than in the baseline scenario.Figure 1: IMF Real GDP Growth Forecasts (%)20132014201520162013201420152016Baseline ScenarioDownside ScenarioSeptember 20125.65.24.8n/a3.02.01.0n/aMarch 20135.04.43.63.1-0.63.73.12.7Source: IMF staff projectionsThe World Bank report also pays close attention to the impact of the PA™s competitiveness of the Palestinian economy. This is deteriorating due to multiple factors: the stagnation of the manufacturing sector; the concentration of exports around low value-added products and few destination markets (with more than 85% of total exports heading to Israel); the structural challenges in the labour market and the poor performance of infrastructure sectors (such as water, 12 www.imf.org/external/country/WBG/RR/2013/031913.pdf3 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_QNAQ42012E.pdfThe Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas approved the Palestinian Authority budget for 2013, which reached $3.81bn.During March the Palestinian Political Risk Insurance was launched and the Jerusalem Arbitration Centre was inaugurated.In Q4 2012 the current by 2.2% compared with the previous quarter, reaching $658.1m.In 2012 a total of 279 olive presses processed nearly 105,000 tonnes of olives, an increase of 12% with respect to 2011.Following the success of Start-up weekend Nablus earlier in January, Start-up Weekend Ramallah took place on 4-6 April.The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

On 19 November, over 200 people attended the ‚Towards a Green Future™ conference which was sponsored by the Italian Government, the PA and UN agencies. Attendees acknowledged green energy and the environment as critical factors for Palestinian economic growth and development. A ‚Joint Declaration™ between Italy and the PA was formalised at the conference and a ‚Technical Steering Committee™ was established to enhance cooperation and development of eco-sustainable activities and projects.1While this is a relatively new area of focus for the Palestinian economy there are a few green projects already underway. In Hebron, a wind turbine will supply 700kw of energy to the Al-Ahli Hospital, covering approximately 40% of its total requirements. Energy costs of the hospital, which is the largest in the West Bank, will be reduced by 30-40% as a result. The EU has contributed •1.3m towards the three-year project, which was launched at the end of September 2009.2Rawabi, the planned new city outside Ramallah, has been designed to be green spaces throughout the commercial and residential areas and special attention has been given to the transport system to reduce the use of cars.

This includes the provision of food and water, as well as cash handouts. Some donors have already responded and $2.5m has been committed by the United Arab Emirates, $1m by India and •1m by Italy. Mauritania, Egypt and Qatar have also each donated $20,000, $25,000 and $50,000 respectively. Based on the immediate response, and last year™s overall commitments from donors, UNRWA expect to secure enough funding to see their emergency service provision maintained at current levels throughout 2010.1Alongside the emergency fund, UNRWA™s General Fund provides core education, healthcare and social services. According to Gunness the working capital of the General Fund dropped to -$7.4m at the beginning of December 2009. Whilst the budget was balanced by the end of December, the General Fund starts 2010 increase their funding this year.In December the European Union pledged •10m to UNRWA™s education programmes and the UK donated £5m for the salaries of teachers working in UNRWA schools. Despite these pledges, Gunness said that the capacity of the General Fund to meet its current commitments, costing approximately $34m per month, is still being determined on a month by month basis.  This includes the salaries of UNRWA™s 30,000 employees. To remedy the situation, cuts to services are under consideration, including a reduction in key medical treatments. UNRWA Director of Operations in Gaza, John Ging, told the Bulletin that cuts to services in Gaza would have a devastating impact. ‚The most basic medical services are already on the brink of collapse, while the impoverished education system is completely overwhelmed by the 450,000 children in Gaza. A lack of education spells doom for an entire generation, and dampens prospects for recovery and future development in Gaza™ he said.  There could also be a wider economic impact if UNRWA jobs have to be cut or salary payments are delayed.there has been an increase in the number of individuals dependent upon UNRWA assistance. Second, there has been a decline in the contributions of major donors.

The report investigated the motivation of those starting businesses and found that across the Palestinian Territory for every 41 entrepreneurs motivated by necessity, 100 were motivated by economic opportunity. The rate of necessity-driven entrepreneurship is higher in Gaza due to the scarcity of business opportunities there.Financing remained a major issue for Palestinian entrepreneurs; the median start-up capital for a new business was $2,095, which is high compared government programmes and informal investors.

Palestine has a very open economy, unlike many countries in the region. We welcome and protect foreign investors. I am very proud of this openness. Despite the challenges, we need to use each and every opportunity to market Palestinian products abroad, to reach new international markets and to give export oriented companies the opportunity to grow. participate in the global EXPO, taking place in Milan. What sector offers the greatest opportunities moving forward?One sector that I believe is particularly important for the Palestinian economy is industry, unfortunately, trade has become dependent on the Israeli market, 97% of imports and 89% of exports are made to/from or through Israel. Tourism is also important for the Palestinian economy. great potential, especially if the political situation is stable.The labour market continues to be characterised by very high unemployment. What should the priorities be for job creation?In order to create employment, sustainable projects are needed. The Palestinian economy is heavily dependent on donors, which come with limited-time projects. Such projects, especially in infrastructure, offer direct, immediate jobs but are not sustainable. Moving forward, additional job creation will need to come from the private sector.  How do you see the role of the private sector and what can the government do to support businesses™ efforts?The Ministry will work closely with the private sector. meetings with representatives of the private sector. I will remain very open and continue to promote  dialogue. In terms of policy, we will focus on creating an adequate enabling environment for expanding businesses.

In the intervening years we have sought to provide accurate insights into the Palestinian economy to our local and global readership. This month I am proud to introduce our 100th issue. I would like to express gratitude to all those who have contributed to the Bulletin over the years. In particular, I would like to thank our partners at MAS for their work and support each month. Without them the Bulletin would not be possible. At the same time, it would be remiss not to acknowledge our readers, not just for reading the Bulletin each month but also for their constructive feedback.As I write, we are at a time of political uncertainty and economic slowdown following the collapse of the peace negotiations in April 2014 and the war in Gaza last summer. Preliminary estimates indicate that the Palestinian economy improvement previously. GDP per capita has only increased marginally over the last two decades and is estimated to have fallen by 5.5% in 2014. In Gaza, GDP per capita has declined by 33% since 1994. Total unemployment is estimated at 27%, with unemployment rates of youth aged 20-24 in the West Bank and Gaza of 27.5% and 68.3%, respectively.The Portland Trust continues to believe that a vibrant private sector-led economy is crucial for sustainable growth and job creation, as well as for peace in the region to take hold. During 2014 we have, therefore, sustained our efforts to support the development of Palestinian businesses through the implementation of ‚Beyond Aid™, an economic initiative by the Palestinian private sector which envisages the creation of almost 400,000 jobs by 2030.1However, it must be acknowledged that any private sector development efforts will be seriously constrained without an improvement to the enabling environment and, in particular, political progress leading to the creation of a thriving Palestinian state. It is therefore absolutely crucial that all concerned parties work together towards achieving a peace efforts.  We hope that the Palestinian Economic Bulletin will continue to inform the public debate and inspire business, policy makers and international organisations to direct their efforts towards the creation of a sustainable economy.  Sir Ronald CohenChairman, The Portland Trust 1 www.portlandtrust.org/publications/beyond-aid-palestinian-private-sector-initiative-investment-growth-and-employmentDr. Nabeel Kassis, MAS Director GeneralMAS perceives its partnership with The Portland Trust as one of high value that enables us to reach out to a Palestinian economy. For MAS, the Palestinian Economic Bulletin is a vital instrument for dispersing knowledge about the Palestinian economy domestically, regionally, and internationally. The constantly growing readership is a testimony of the success of this endeavour. Through its nearly decade-long history (since 2006) and its 100 issues, the Bulletin has recorded moments of impressive growth as well as disappointing stagnation and even declines in the economy. Last year was a challenging one for all, especially the second half following the devastating effects of the war in the summer in Gaza. We start 2015 with the hope that there will be more positive news for the Bulletin to write about in the comming months.Bulletin 100 Œ January 2015',\n",

Nominal GDP per capita reached $3,186 in 2013, registering stark differences between the West Bank ($4,200) and Gaza ($1,715).1 Overall real GDP growth slowed in Q4 2013, reaching only 0.3% with respect to the previous quarter (as a result of a 1.2% increase in the West Bank and a 2.3% drop in Gaza). Annual growth between 2012 and 2013 is estimated at just over 2%.2between 2006 and 2011 (reaching 12% in 2011) before falling to 5.9% in 2012. It is broadly recognised that much of the growth over these years was largely fueled by donor support. As international aid declined in the years running up to 2012 the Palestinian economy consequently slowed. Sustainable recovery sector-led growth. Comparing the contributions of key economic sectors over time it appears that there has been an underlying structural shift in the Palestinian economy. Agriculture now only constitutes 3.7% of GDP, down from 7.1% in 2004 and 13.3% in 1994. Conversely the retail sector is now a larger part of the economy, increasing from 9.8% in 2004 to 17.8% in 2013. The construction sector contributed over 11% to Palestinian GDP in 2013.

The conference, attended by representatives of EU and Arab League countries, the World Bank, the IMF, various UN agencies and different Arab and Islamic organisations, secured a total of $5.4bn in pledges from international donors. Around half of this sum is expected to be directly allocated to Gaza, with the rest going to support other funding needs of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).2 Funding for much needed early recovery and reconstruction works is expected to include major contributions from Qatar ($1bn), the EU ($568m), the US ($212m), the UAE ($200m) and Turkey ($200m).3 Discussions during the conference also focused on the need to strengthen the Palestinian government™s ability to assume its responsibilities in the rehabilitation of Gaza, as well as the necessary mechanisms to enable the import and export of goods and materials to and from Gaza (by building on existing efforts by the UN). Prior to the conference, the Palestinian government™s Higher Inter-Ministerial Committee for Gaza Recovery and Reconstruction presented an impact assessment of the latest operation and a comprehensive strategy for the implementation of recovery measures.4 The governmental plan, developed with assistance from a broad range of stakeholders (including Palestinian line ministries, the local private sector and different international organisations), is aimed at transitioning from urgent relief efforts to longer-term development needs, across four areas: social protection, infrastructure, economic development and governance and institution building. While short-term efforts will focus on ensuring rapid improvements to the lives of the thousands of affected citizens, the government™s long-term vision for Gaza The PNA plan is structured around three phases (Table 1): an urgent relief phase including rapid and short-term interventions ($414m); an early recovery phase involving interventions of up to 12 months ($1.2bn); and a reconstruction and development phase, expected to be implemented over the longer term ($2.4bn). The social sector chapter of the plan is aimed at combatting poverty, vulnerability and food insecurity in Gaza, which increased sharply as a result of extensive 1 www.mfa.gov.eg/gazaconference/default_en.html2 www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29586636 3 already pledged, bringing the total U.S. contribution to $414 million.

The overall quarter-to-quarter rise in GDP was due in part to a 31.1% increase in construction activities. Services activities remained the largest contributor to GDP (21%) and employment (35.7%) in Q2 2015.2Real quarterly GDP in the West Bank ($1,501.3m) increased by 5.1% in Q2 compared to the previous quarter and 3.3% from Q2 2014.

In Gaza, real GDP increased by 8.9% compared to the previous quarter, while it decreased by 1.5% compared to Q2 2014 - signalling that the recovery to the pre-war economic output level in Gaza is still underway.

As part of this, of the census. The use of GIS devices in the production of the census will allow for more reliable data at the lowest possible geographical level to be collected in a time in the development of the National Statistical System.Another priority is collecting data on Palestinians in Diaspora, where we have already implemented two surveys in coordination with the UN and other relevant governmental agencies within Lebanon. We are currently in the preparation phase to conduct a Population Census for the Palestinian Refugees in Refugee Camps and Localities nearby the camps in Lebanon.What are your strategies for adapting to such volatile environment?PCBS keeps on working uninterruptedly under the most challenging circumstances, even during the Gaza war last is answering their needs of data covering all aspects of life, we have adopted several strategies such as: enforcing the focusing on the capacity building of our staff, as they are the resource that we depend on to keep functioning and be able to secure reliable data in a timely manner.  PCBS is characterized by its innovative and open approach and agenda. What are some of the top innovations you™re seeing in the collection and use of statistics? PCBS focuses on strengthening statistical knowledge and raising awareness of statistics. As part of this work, PCBS is ensuring that the school curricula contains statistics We use a variety of media such as cartoons, animation, and infographics to create and enhance awareness among our students. Furthermore, through adopting social media such as the PCBS Website, Facebook, and Twitter, we ensure that data is disseminated in a wider range of people.

I believe this will help put Palestine on the global map and is recognition of the high professionalism of our organization.  My goal as the President of IAOS is to strengthen the organization through better engagement with its members. My strategy for achieving this includes four that the work of IAOS is relevant to its members and to other peer organizations. Second, maintain visibility at statistical events to maintain an appropriate role in global statistical directions. Third, build new partnerships and develop existing ones so IAOS can better serve the global statistical community. Finally, institutionalize the work of IAOS so that in the future the organization can focus on developmental issues rather than managerial matters.has been elected as the president of IAOS and such an opportunity is a golden one. It will assist in shedding light on how data is being produced under challenging circumstances, which are no longer limited to Palestine but are being faced by various countries within the region such as Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Yemen, and Libya. Such data is of high importance since it can help show what is happening on the ground and what interventions should be mobilized.I aim to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries in several international priorities such as moving from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Finally, one of our goals will be to draw attention to the challenges faced I believe if we are able to succeed in this, we will leave a well needed imprint on the global agenda.',\n",

This expansion followed a sharp contraction of 9.1% in Q3 2014 following the war in Gaza. Real GDP in the West Bank ($1,470.9m) increased by 4% from Q3 2014 and by 4.9% from Q4 2013. In Gaza, which had seen real GDP fall by 28.4% in Q3 2014, GDP rose by 18.5% in the last quarter of 2014 to $407.7m, indicating a partial recovery from the economic damage caused by the war in the summer. Public administration and defence continued to make up a very high proportion of GDP in Gaza, at 35.6%, compared to just 7% in the West Bank. Much of the growth in Gaza was driven by improvements in construction and wholesale & retail trade (up by 64%, although again still substantially lower than the levels achieved throughout 2013 and up to Q2 2014).

For 2014 as a whole, national real GDP is estimated to have decreased by 0.4% overall, which when disaggregated translates into a 5.1% rise in the West Bank and a substantial 15.2% fall in Gaza.

Deceleration was greatest in agriculture, where value added dropped by almost 10% on a year-to-year basis. As a result, agricultural activities accounted for 3.6% of total value added in the West Bank in Q3 2013, down from 4.1% in Q3 2012.Gazan GDP also registered a low overall year-to-year growth of 2.8% in Q3 2013, mostly as a result of a 19% drop in the value added by construction activities. In Q1 2013, construction represented 27.1% of GDP in the Gaza Strip and accounted for 80% of the observed 12% year-to-year growth. Following the slowdown in Q3 2013, construction™s contribution to GDP dropped to less than 21%The disappointing growth performance in Q3 2013, with rates below the long-term population growth rate, resulted in a year-to-year absolute decrease in GDP per capita. Palestinian real GDP per head in Q3 2013, at $419, was 0.4% lower than in Q3 2012. The annual drop was more pronounced in the Gaza Strip (-0.7%), where GDP per capita reached $272, than in the West Bank (-0.2%; $520).

The trade dispute reached its height on 9 February, when the GoI imposed a ban on all Palestinian agricultural exports, both through Israeli ports and via Jordan, the West Bank™s only direct export route to the outside world.2 According to the Palestinian Export Council, which mobilized in early February to coordinate the Palestinian response to these measures, preventing Palestinians from exporting agricultural products to the rest of the world is considered a breach of the Paris Protocol and World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements.The ban occurred at the peak of the agricultural export season and two months prior to Ramadan, when demand for agricultural produce is at its peak. These developments put further strain on the Palestinian agricultural sector, which faces limited access to land, water, and international markets. Further economic threats face the sector if the GoI proceeds with the annexation of the Jordan Valley,3  which accounts for 60% of vegetables produced in the West Bank and almost 100% of the date harvest in Palestine. On 5 February, a few days prior to the announcement of the total ban, the PNA announced its intention to limit the entry of Israeli products into the Palestinian market, focusing on vegetables, fruits, juices, mineral water, and carbonated drinks.4 It™s decision was in response to an earlier development, on 31 January, when the Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett directed the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to halt the imports of all Palestinian agricultural products into Israel. Palestine exports around $132m of agricultural goods annually, of which 68% ($88m) are exported to Israel.5 Palestinian exports to Israel include tomatoes, potatoes, beans, cucumbers, peppers, onions, and zucchini.6 a solution to the cattle issue. In response, the PNA asserted that the GoI had not abided by the agreement reached in December 2019, whereby the GoI would allow direct import of 10,000 calves from abroad, setting up a special cattle quarantine station and entry of Palestinian eggs to Israeli markets. Trade tensions have been on the rise since September 2019, when the PNA announced its decision to cease calf imports from Israel.7 According to the PNA, this move was a part of a broader strategy to diversify sources of imports and decrease reliance on the Israeli economy.8 123 https://bit.ly/2V8cN7G; https://bit.ly/3bUdjfJ; and see B157 https://bit.ly/2VjsJEq 4 http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=x43r4va115027915827ax43r4v5 https://bit.ly/2vnjGr0; https://bit.ly/2SiSUZK67 See B158 for further details: https://bit.ly/2vaJU07  8 www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/275400',\n",

Monitoring of almost 300 presses over three months showed that more than 70% of all presses operate with over 10% wasted oil in peat, above the 5-8% international average. Only 8 presses in Palestine registered less than 5% waste in peat, indicating a large scope productivity.

The report presents a concrete steps which can be taken now to help support private sector led growth.1The report notes that the main constraints to private sector development are the restrictions imposed by the Government of Israel (GoI), but argues that it is very important for the Palestinian Authority (PA) to take steps to improve the business environment, both to help prepare the ground for a future possible state and to encourage increased investment now. The World Bank suggests several priorities to help improve the business environment: accelerating the process of land registration; continuing to develop beyond the banking sector; establishing an independent telecommunications regulator and making more progress in the legal environment, including passing the competition law.  A substantial section of the report is devoted to steps that can be taken to improve problem, the World Bank points out that high unemployment rates can also be caused by skill mismatches where workers are not equipped for the demands of skills as well as the low level of competencies and experience of graduates to be among the most important constraints to employment of youth in the West Bank and Gaza.™ The World Bank suggests that although the PA has ensured high levels of school attendance and literacy, it needs to do more to support innovative programmes with an emphasis on critical thinking, problem-solving and hands-on learning experiences. In line with this, the World Bank recommends strengthening ties between the technical and vocational education and training institutions and the private sector. In addition, the PA needs to facilitate the transition from education to work by providing graduates with job matching services.Regarding early childhood development, the Bank highlights some of the PA™s successes: for instance the West Bank and Gaza is an outstanding performer in terms of indicators for early childhood nutrition. Equally, school enrollment has always been high, and access to primary education is near universal. However despite this, the quality of education and basic learning outcomes need to be improved.In terms of foreign trade, the World Bank underlines that the Palestinian economy needs to focus on trade in intermediate goods and on exports of high value products. a better business environment (to attract investment), improved trade facilitation (to reduce costs) and a highly skilled labour force with high levels of productivity.1 siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/GrowthStudyEng.pdfThe Palestinian Authority and Government of Israel have agreed on new arrangements regarding the transfer of goods between Israel and the Palestinian Territory and related tax procedures.

Under its baseline scenario, which assumes no major changes in the economic and political situation, the PCBS forecast 3.8% growth in real GDP in 2016 resulting in 0.9% growth in real GDP per capita. The number of employees is forecast to rise by 7.7% bringing unemployment down to 25%. Government revenues are forecast to increase by 4.6% due to improvements in tax collection while Government expenses would fall by 1.7%, resulting in a 3.5% by 1.9%. This is due to an expected rise in the value of Palestinian imports by 3.9% and an increase in value of Palestinian exports by 7.4%.The PMA acknowledges that economic forecasts are sensitive to changes in economic and political stability, especially in the Palestinian context characterised by a high-risk environment. If the present economic and political conditions continue, the PMA forecasts a 3.3% growth in real GDP in 2016. Growth would be driven by an increase in private consumption fuelled by a rise in indebtedness and banking loans. The contribution of private consumption to real GDP is expected to rise to 79.9%, while the public sector contribution would decline to 21%.  Exports and imports are forecast to increase by 6.6% and 8.3%, rate climbs to 2%.These baseline projections for 2016 are similar to those presented by the IMF in September 20153. In the Report to the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, the IMF forecast real GDP growth of 3.9% in 2016. Unemployment was forecast to rise to 28% and The Annual Reports analyse the potential risks, both positive and negative, that are likely to impact key economic indicators and set out a number of scenarios. The PCBS ﬁoptimisticﬂ scenario, which is based on an improved political and economic situation, forecasts the economy to expand by 7% leading to a 4% increase in real GDP per capita. The unemployment rate would decline to 23.1% after an 11.6% increase in the number of employees. Government revenues and expenditure would rise by 13.4% and 9.8% respectively. As expenditure is greater The PMA forecasts that economic growth might reach 7.1% in 2016 should positive economic and political shocks occur, including an improvement in the political and security conditions, acceleration in the reconstruction of Gaza and the implementation of major projects.1 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_Forecasting2016E.pdf2 http://bit.ly/20s6fuK and http://bit.ly/1QrBukY3 www.imf.org/external/country/WBG/RR/2015/092115.pdfPresident Mahmoud Abbas approved the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) budget for 2016 in January.

The trade challenges are on the supply side. Exports include olive oil, stone and marble and furniture and constitute 7% of GDP, when the average for lower middle-income countries is 17%.The main developmental problems are trade policy having been conditioned by the Paris Protocol and national developmental plans never prioritising trade policy. The latter is changing as the new national strategy gives more attention to trade policy. With regards to industrial policies, all efforts have been focused on improving the business only 81 manufacturing companies employing more than 50 workers. Most of the economy is comprised of family-run micro and small enterprises with a high proportion of family workers. Who are Palestine™s key strategic trade partners and what is the way forward to enhance trade with them?Palestine is exporting around $10m to Europe per year, $5m to the US and practically nothing to Canada although we have free market access. The most utilised agreement is the Greater Arab Free Trade Agreement (GAFTA). The problem is that there is no supply-side capacity. Palestine does not have the products which the world market is demanding. You cannot export what you produce; you should export what the world wants. Even in GAFTA, 67% of the increase in exports is due to olive oil, stone and marble. The way forward is to look at what the world wants and what of that Palestine can produce and then implement industrial policies to develop those sectors.What is the optimal trade regime under the current circumstances?Soon our project will present a proposal of trade policy for Palestine, including a tariff component. In a study that will be published by MAS soon, we are analysing what would be the most appropriate tariff policy. What is clear is that the Paris Protocol arrangements are completely dysfunctional for the Palestinian economy. The tariff schedule adequate for Israel is not adequate for Palestine, which needs to use tariffs as an instrument of industrial policy Œ to lower the cost of some inputs and protect sectors that have potential. It is the typical ﬁinfant industryﬂ argument. New companies need time to become competitive. WTO? What are the next steps towards its realisation?Palestine is de facto implementing all WTO obligations, because of the Paris Protocol and because Israel is a is the availability of the dispute settlement mechanism, a forum where small countries can defend their interests. Another one is that the WTO agreements are international best practices in many areas, such as technical standards and trade facilitation for the private sector, so being a member would allow Palestine to put its house in order.before starting accession negotiations, which last up to ten years. Palestine requested an observer status in 2009, but no action was taken. Now the Government is exploring the possibility of presenting another request.

       " 'january-2017.pdf': 'The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4Bulletin Special Feature  January 2017PAYING FOR SUCCESS: SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT IMPACT BONDSINTRODUCTIONPalestine needs new ways of tackling some persistent and costly social problems such as high levels of unemployment, large numbers of young people that are neither in education or employment, and high rates of preventable deaths from chronic diseases such as diabetes. Government, the private sector and civil society organisations are under increasing pressure to help tackle these problems, in a context of declining levels of aid. Social impact investment is one tool that governments all over the world are using to solve enduring social and economic problems youth unemployment (UK) and supporting small scale farmers (Peru).Impact investments can have greatest impact when funding is linked to outcomes. Traditionally, commissioners prescribe and pay for a particular service that they believe will lead to a desired social outcome, known as a ‚fee for service™ contract. However, commissioners are moving towards funding approaches that pay on the basis of outcomes (e.g. reduced unemployment) rather than activities (session In a DIB, investors are repaid by non-government parties such as aid agencies and philanthropists. DIBs, therefore, are part of an effort to apply and adapt SIBs to international development. For this reason, use of outcomes contracts in Palestine may initially be driven by DIBs.This note looks at how impact bonds have been used around the world and sets out how DIBs could best be applied in Palestine. It is organised as follows:In theory - what are impact bonds and why are they useful?In practice Œ when are they useful and at what scale?Next steps - actions to accelerate the use of DIBs in Palestine.Outcomes ContractAny contract between a government and a service provider that involves some element of payment for outcomes achieved, also known as Payment by Results (PbR).CommissionerAny government, donor or foundation with responsibility for buying service provision (typically from an external provider).Social Impact Bond (SIB)Any arrangement made by a service provider to access off-InvestorThe role of the investor in a SIB or DIB contract is to provide funds upfront for services, to be repaid if outcomes are achieved.Development Impact Bond (DIB)The DIB is conceptually the same as a SIB, but non-government parties (such as aid agencies and philanthropists) pay for the outcomes delivered instead of the government.Outcomes FunderThe role of the outcomes funder in a SIB or DIB contract is to have been achieved.use in Palestine remains embryonic. Four priority actions could accelerate the use of DIBs in Palestine:1.Provide support for capacity building for service providers.Services providers, especially early adopters, may requireadditional resources to perform under an outcomes contract,compared to contracting on a pure fee for service basis. Forexample, service providers have to be able to demonstratetheir impact and that they can take on additional funds andscale up their activities. They also have to possess requisitebusiness planning competences to reassure investors thatmoney will be spent judiciously. Grants and business supportcould be made available on a rolling basis to help supportinvestment and bid for outcomes contracts.In the U.S., the Social Innovation Fund Pay for SuccessInitiative awarded over $20m to support feasibility andtechnical assistance for SIBs. More than 50 service providersare currently using federal funds to explore feasibility orsupport project development.  Grants have increasinglyfocused on building the enabling infrastructure for suchprojects, especially cross-system data sharing.  To date, 15SIB transactions have closed in the U.S.2.Support coordination and collaboration between donors.Donors can play the role of either investor or market builderor both. The Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) of the Inter-American Development Bank has allocated $5.3m to exploreSIBs across Latin America. The programme offers support forthe design of and investment in SIBs, including by creatinglocal capabilities amongst governments and other parties.with the goal of lifting poor, female-head households out ofpoverty. The State of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and the Municipalityof Buenos Aires (Argentina) are also receiving MIF™s supportfor the development of SIBs.The fragmentation of public spending across differentgovernment departments and authorities can makeUK Government establishing its Social Outcomes FinanceFund, which acts as an additional central funding streamand encourages different departments to contribute to SIBprojects. In Palestine, this could be addressed by donorscollectively creating a fund to contribute to outcome payments for DIBs.To date, the UK has allocated nearly £200m for outcomes funds. In the U.S., the Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for ResultsAct would establish a $300 million outcomes fund, housedapproved by the House of Representatives.  It is expected topass the House again in early 2017, with supporters hopeful for Senate passage.3.Improve metrics.  Outcomes measurement and evaluation arekey issues for SIBs and DIBs and may require additional skills to those required to contract on a fee for service basis. Building an evidence base of costs would help commissioners assess howmuch they would be willing to pay for outcomes. In 2013, theUK Government published a Unit Cost Database, a free onlineresource to facilitate SIB development which provides detailed National Advisory Board on Impact Investing provided apractical guide to understanding social costs, including applied examples on teen parenthood and homelessness.9 The NewSouth Wales Government has also committed to publishing unit cost data as part of their strategy.10Work in this area could build on existing efforts to developeffective performance management, such as OpenRBF (a tool11 and a standardized tool to cost early childhood interventions.124.Support awareness and knowledge sharing and information.terminology can be confusing.  The partnerships, the datacollection, setting metrics and payment mechanisms canbe new to commissioners and service providers and requireexplanation. These issues could be addressed by providingonline information and resources relevant to DIBs. Forfor Social Impact Bonds as a central resource for knowledgeand best practice for central and local government, deliverypartners, investors and intermediaries.At the global level, The Global Social Impact InvestmentSteering Group (GSG) was established in August 2015 asthe successor to the Social Impact Investment Taskforceestablished by the G8. The GSG works to catalyse a globalsocial impact investment market across its current 13 member countries plus the EU, as well as through active observers from government and leading network organisations supportiveof impact investment, including the OECD and the GlobalImpact Investing Network. The GSG is working to increaseincluding SIBs and DIBs, facilitating knowledge exchange and encouraging policy change in national markets.DIBs have great potential, and are particularly well suited to tackling some of Palestine™s most pressing social issues.

The ultimate test for SIBs and DIBs is to see if they deliver better outcomes for society and improve peoples™ lives.910 www.osii.nsw.gov.au1112The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared and edited by The Portland Trust.

My sister, Dr Grace Khoury, who is also the Director of the MBA Programme at Birzeit University, plays an important part in the marketing of Taybeh Beer What is your presence in international markets? Where do you source your production and packing inputs? In 1998 we franchised the production of Taybeh Beer in Germany to access European markets, following From there we source the German market and also export to other European countries. In 2005 we began exporting directly to Japan from Palestine, where all Carrefour stores now sell our beer, together with other Palestinian products. We are now also considering brewing Taybeh Beer in Jordan, after we had to stop exporting there due to a major increase in taxes by the Jordanian authorities. We are also exploring opportunities to brew Taybeh beer in the USA.Regarding inputs, we have to import everything but water: our malt comes from Belgium and France; hops from Bavaria and the Czech Republic; yeast from England and packaging material from Israel. We used to import bottles from Portugal but then shipping containers started to be repeatedly held in the Israeli port, for periods of up to 70 days. Because of this we had to face extra storage costs and custom fees (making a bottle originally costing 0.5 Israeli supplier.How do you see the prospects for the Palestinian economy?The current situation is very challenging but I am hopeful we will have a bright future if we achieve peace and stability.

Establishments closed down; there was no tourism and with no port or airport in Palestine and all of our inputs coming via Israel, we had to lay off staff and faced closure. I remember that many who had returned after Oslo closed their businesses and left Palestine.

Moreover, the winery is located on the ground level of the new 80-room Taybeh Golden Hotel we are currently constructing as part of our activities in the tourism sector. Will you continue to organise the Oktoberfest festival in Taybeh alongside these new developments? How did the idea of the festival come about? From the beginning our company has been orientated towards tourism and we want to play an active role in the industry. Whilst I was Mayor of Taybeh from 2005 I helped create the Taybeh Oktoberfest. The festival has now run for eight years, attracting tourists from all over the world to visit Taybeh and to experience the culture, music, food and drink of Palestine. We also encourage those attending the festival to buy local products, including olive oil, honey, soap and embroidery. We hope that Oktoberfest will carry on for many years to come and that local tourism is further enhanced by the new hotel, which will be integrated with the winery and micro-brewery, as part of a broader agritourism offering in Taybeh.

Some of the largest Palestinian private sector players are partnering and sponsoring the event. In addition, international support is coming from USAID, DFID and the Islamic Development Bank.2The conference hopes to encourage business relations between regional and international investors and the Palestinian private sector. A number of announcements about new investment programmes and partnerships are anticipated. Details of the work being done to improve The Director General of PIPA, and the CEO of the conference, Jafaar Hdaib, told the Bulletin that ‚the event is an important milestone on the path to establishing the Palestinian State which is part of Prime Minister Dr. Salam Fayyad™s two-year plan ‚Ending the Occupation, Building the State™ (2009-2011). Palestinian companies to be showcased come from a variety of sectors, including manufacturing, tourism, IT, housing and construction, agriculture, energy and infrastructure. The agenda includes sectoral and plenary sessions, B2B meetings, cultural activities and off site visits. There will be a welcome reception and dinner on 1 June and Palestinian following day. An exhibition of Palestinian products will run alongside the main event.According to Hdaib 1,100 foreign participants have registered for the conference, far exceeding expectations. Over half of registered participants are the heads or general managers of the companies they represent. Around 540 are coming from the Arab world, 200 from Europe, the US and Canada and the remaining 360 are Palestinian Diaspora. PIPA and the PA are making logistical arrangements to ease participants™ entry to Bethlehem and applying for permits where necessary.1  See: http://www.pic-palestine.ps/ 2 For details of PIC partners and sponsors See: http://www.pic-palestine.ps/etemplate.php?id=86Private sector credit from the banking sector was $1.56bn at the end of January 2010, up from $1.18bn at the end of December 2008. The loan to deposit ratio was 36%, up from 31% at the end of January 2009.28 out of 36 companies were recorded by PALTEL ($23.2m).According to Paltrade there has been a 52% increase in the number of trucks leaving the West Bank with exports compared to last year. PCBS forecast that the value of exports will increase 3.4% this year. Support for the PA budget has recently been provided by the UK ($25m), the EU ($10m) and Algeria ($26m).The baseline scenario assumes the situation in the Palestinian Territory remains the same as 2009. It forecasts a 4.2% increase in real GDP, a 1.3% increase in GDP per capita and that private investment will reach $1,454m.If there was political and economic progress in 2010 then the PCBS expects real GDP to increase by 8.8% and real GDP per capita by 5.8%. Private investment would increase by 6.5% to reach $1,484m. This optimistic scenario assumes a fully-funded reconstruction effort in the Gaza Strip, an increase in the number of Palestinian workers employed in Israel, ongoing support for the PA budget and increased implementation of investment and development projects in the Palestinian Territory.However if political and economic conditions deteriorate, and external donor support falls, the PCBS predicts a 6% contraction in real GDP, an 8.6% fall in real GDP per capita and a drop in private investment of 2.8%.A comparison between the 2009 forecast and actual results shows that GDP growth of 6.8% in 2009 far exceeded even the optimistic forecast (3.2% growth). The IMF baseline and pessimistic forecasts published in the Bulletin last month are comparable to the PCBS optimistic and baseline scenario respectively. The IMF did not publish an optimistic scenario.24 Listings on the PSEThere are now 40 companies listed on the Palestine Securities Exchange (PSE).

The most recent data reveals GDP growth of only 0.5% in Gaza during 2017. Unemployment reached 44% during the same period, despite a low labour participation rate of 75% for males and 18% for females. The quality of life for most Gaza residents is deteriorating, especially as access to basic utilities and services has continued to decline.1 Electricity ShortageBy 6 February 2018, emergency electricity generators ran out of fuel in three out of Gaza™s 13 hospitals and 14 out of its 54 medical centres.2 On 14 February, the Gaza supply of diesel fuel required to operate the plant.3 The possibility of additional medical facilities shutting down due to the lack of electricity was averted through a $3.5m donation towards emergency fuel supplies from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and the State of Qatar. The donation covers 54% of the $6.5m required for the most critical medical facilities to continue their operations in 2018.4While the GPP™s total capacity is 140 MW, since 22 January 2018, it has produced at most 25 MW of electricity. The lack of fuel to operate the plant is mainly due to political and funding disputes which impact the provision of fuel imported from Egypt.5 Housing ShortageHasayneh announced that Gaza requires about 125,000 new housing units to meet current demand, in addition to 24,000 existing housing units that require full reconstruction.614,000 housing units each year on average. Currently, there are 285,000 housing units in Gaza, of which 55,000 need restoration or rehabilitation, while 20% of the Palestinian families in Gaza live in densely populated residential units with population growth rates of at least 3.3%.7 Gaza Reconstruction MechanismA joint review of the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism (GRM) has been agreed between the Government of Israel (GoI) and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) following a meeting on 14 February with Palestinian Prime Minister Dr. Rami Hamdallah, the GoI™s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), Major General Yoav Mordechai, and United Nations (UN) Special Coordinator Mr. 1 https://bit.ly/2DPE6aM 2 https://reut.rs/2HYAV2W 34567On 1 March 2018, the North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment Facility in Brussels on the Gaza Central Desalination Plant on 20 March 2018, raising •456m for what will be the biggest ever infrastructure On 13 March 2018, the Reconstruction and a $5m loan to Cairo Amman Palestinian businessesto study the use of social media in Palestine, released Social and Digital Media in Palestine during 2017The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

Ali Hayek, head of the Palestinian Businessmen Association, warned that the industrial sector in Gaza is at the highest risk, as it has lost over 10,000 jobs since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis leading to a 19% drop in productivity.42 Gaza Hotels and Tourist Restaurants Commission chairman Salah Abu Hasira said: ﬁabout 5,000 workers in tourist establishments in the Gaza Strip Š who support about 25,000 people Š are now unemployed without any other source of income.ﬂ43 This has reduced the purchasing power of households in Gaza and indirectly affected other economic sectors that were not part of the precautionary measures. Jamal al-Khudari, head of the Popular Committee Against the Siege in the Gaza Strip said: ﬁthe economic losses in Gaza amounted to $200 million during the month of March. These losses include the economic, industrial, commercial, contracting, and tourism sectors.

The projections were prepared in cooperation with the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) as part of a research project funded by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).1 To develop the projections, MAS and PCBS utilised a macroeconomic simulation model based on data series for the past 30 years. The projections address baseline, optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. The analysis shows that under each of the three scenarios, Palestine is likely to suffer from recession in 2019. Assuming expected to continue to slow down during 2019, reaching a GDP growth rate of 0.7% and an unemployment rate of 32.8%.Table 1.

The programme, funded by the UK Department for International Development and the European Union, aims to improve the competitiveness of the Palestinian private sector through technical assistance and matching grants. In response to the urgent needs of factories and other businesses that were affected during the latest war in Gaza, the PMDP has introduced ﬁGaza Back to Businessﬂ (GBB).1 Unlike traditional compensation schemes, GBB is speciÞcally aimed at assisting companies that have suffered physical damage and are facing challenges to resume their business operations. Helping the private sector in Gaza to recover after severe interruption of economic activity during the war is an absolute priority. More than 420 industrial enterprises were destroyed, 36,000 dunams of agricultural land were damaged and 13,000 greenhouses were partially or totally demolished. In the aftermath of the operation it was reported that up to 30,000 workers employed in affected establishments were unable to work. Through GBB more than 50 companies are expected to receive support in the next 6-9 months to Þnance maintenance services, conduct assessment studies, acquire inputs, buy and install machinery, repair and reconstruct facilities, rent space for temporary relocation (for a period of up to 6 months) and cover labour and transport costs. The programme™s new window offers a Þxed grant of 75% of total funding needs (with the rest being covered by the beneÞciaries), in comparison to the original range of 25-75%. Grant ceilings per company will remain unchanged at £50,000. Priority will be given to businesses able to create signiÞcant impact in the short term while also delivering sustainable success beyond the period of assistance. Other criteria for eligibility focus on ease of implementation, including the availability of production inputs.In related news, after visiting Gaza on 11 December, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Mr Robert Serry, announced that pursuant to the trilateral agreement reached between the Palestinian Government, the Government of Israel and the UN earlier in September 2014, some 20,000 home owners in Gaza would have access to much needed building materials for the repair of their damaged homes by the end of the month.2 The UN-brokered mechanism aims to ensure that construction materials entering Gaza are exclusively used for their intended purpose, for which the UN has agreed to undertake checks to monitor compliance. The donor-funded mechanism has been subject to criticism by Palestinian businesses and individuals following delays in its effective implementation, with local sources reporting that the ßow of materials into Gaza has not improved consistently.

Several workshops and sessions, led by the Ministry of National Economy, were held 2 One of the most important amendments aims to simplify investment procedures and reduce bureaucracy. The existing investment department has been reformed with representatives from the relevant ministries (including the Ministry of National Economy, Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Finance) playing a bigger role. This will facilitate the faster processing of important licenses and permits. The investment department will also be responsible for following up with investors and ministries as required. The Palestinian Investment Promotion Agency (PIPA) will also be reformed. The PIPA Board will be increased to include 17 members, seven of which will be representatives of private sector institutions and a representative of the Ministry of Local government.3 The amendments grant tax exemptions and incentives to new sectors such as real estate development and environmental projects as well as amending the terms of exemption for other sectors. For example, projects in the ICT sector are now granted tax exemptions based on the number of employees, not on the size of capital. Tourism, health and education projects are granted additional exemptions from customs duties and taxes on procurement of furniture and enjoy the same incentives and exemptions. if recommended by the PIPA Board and approved by the Council of Ministers.4 The minimum threshold for eligible investment projects has been raised to The law is yet to be put into effect, as this will follow a public information campaign about the new law, which will take place in Palestinian newspapers later in February or early March.

Real GDP is expected to increase by 0.5% and the GDP per capita to decrease by 2%. The unemployment rate is expected to stay high, at 31.5% in 2019. The Optimistic Scenario4 assumes an improved political and economic situation that allows for real GDP to increase by 5% during 2019 and GDP per capita to increase by 2%. Unemployment would fall back to 2017 levels of 29% during 2019. The Pessimistic Scenario,5 assumes a deteriorating political and economic situation where GDP is projected to decrease by 3% during 2019 and GDP per capita would decrease by 5%. The number of Palestinian employees in Israel would decrease by 12%, thus increasing unemployment to 33%.The PMA™s separate forecasting exercise largely corresponds to the projections of the PCBS. Despite the different methodologies and modelling techniques employed, both forecasts agree on the range of possible GDP outcomes and are 6 However, in the baseline scenario, PMA™s forecasts project slightly higher real GDP and per capita GDP growth prospects, based on its expectation that the same challenges constraining economic growth in 2018 would continue. Furthermore, the range between the PMA™s worst and best outlook is narrower than that forecasted by PCBS.1 Given the limitations in obtaining economic data from Gaza, the forcasts do not allow separate modelling of the West Bank and Gazan economies.2 www.pcbs.gov.ps/post.aspx?lang=en&ItemID=3341 3budget, declining clearance revenues from Israel, increased government transfers, income tax collection and value of credit facilities, continuing restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries and population growth (birth and mortality rates) in Palestine remaining at current levels.4 Optimistic scenario economic and political assumptions based on political reconciliation between the West Bank and Gaza, reconstruction of Gaza and donor support for Government budget, increased clearance revenues increased development expenditure, decreased restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries, and population  (birth and mortality rates) growth below current levels.5 Pessimistic scenario economic and political assumptions based on decreased donor support for Government clearance value added taxes, decrease in income tax collection, and a decrease in development expenditures, increased restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries and the number of workers in Israel decreasing.6The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) published its preliminary estimates on the performance of the Palestinian Economy in 2018The Private Sector Coordination Council calls for an emergency economic development programme for GazaOn 23 December 2018, the PCBS published its Balance of Payments and International Investment Position reports for the third quarter of 2018On an annual basis, the Al-Quds index decreased by 7.9% compared to the last day of trading in 2017The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

The strategy was prepared by the PMA in cooperation with the banking sector and other stakeholders and was approved by the Palestinian Cabinet in mid-2018. the use of electronic payment methods in local transactions, in both the private and the public sectors. This includes the launch of a system that will allow for the automated electronic transfer of the wages of Palestinian workers in Israel directly to their personal bank accounts on a monthly basis and with minimal fees.1 The PMA will also work to allow the use of electronic payment cards issued by Israeli banks for purchases by Palestinians from Israel in local markets. According to the Governor  of the PMA, Mr Azzam Al Shawwa, the accumulation of New Israeli Shekels (NIS) in the Palestinian market is mainly caused by the excessive reliance on cash in local economic transactions, in addition to cash payment of the wages of  around130,000 Palestinian workers in Israel (a monthly average of around NIS 600 million), and the purchases made by Palestinian Israeli citizens when they visit the West Bank, estimated by the PMA at an average of NIS 250 million monthly.2 One of the main goals of the strategy is to curb the accumulation of Israeli Shekels in circulation in Palestine, due to the negative impact of the surplus on the stability of the Palestinian banking system and the Palestinian economy.3 The build-up of cash, mostly in shekels, in Palestinian markets is particularly costly to imposed on Palestinian banks by the Government of Israel (GoI).4 Any excess cash beyond the ceiling imposed by the GoI (currently limited to one billion Shekels per month5) continues to be retained within the Palestinian banking system with large quantities of cash, the loss of potential interest on cash (above permitted transfer ceilings) that might otherwise be deposited in Israeli banks, and the holdings by Palestinian banks of excessive surplus capital leading to a drag on their return on equity (ROE). 1 www.pma.ps/Default.aspx?tabid=205&ArtMID=793&ArticleID=2380&language=en-US 2 Around NIS 3 billion annually: these unrecorded ﬁexportsﬂ to Palestinian consumers from Israel are approximately equivalent in value to the total annual registered Palestinian merchandise exports to Israel.

The opportunity is simply too big and too positive to be ignored. Efforts by President Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are by far the largest, solution I have ever seen. Our hope is that the solution will be fair and balanced and uphold all the principles and values of freedom, equality and human rights.

According to recent estimates by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) and the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), real GDP (2015 prices) increased by 1.2% during 2019, which GDP per capita decreased by 1.3%.1 Growth in 2019 was driven by a 3.6% growth in Q4 2019 following the release of clearance revenues, otherwise, the economy crisis. Growth in Q4 2019 was mainly the result of an increase in the value added of construction (17%) and services activities (8%).Economic performance in 2019 was better than had been forecasted by both the PMA and PCBS at the beginning of the year with GDP above the baseline projection (Table 1).  In particular, unemployment decreased from 26.8% in 2018 to 26%, even earlier PMA projections of 0.7%.2have been powered by an external shock rather than structural change or resilience within the economy. Among these possible external factors was a 9.3% increase in Palestinians gaining employment in Israel during Q3 20193 compared to Q2 2019 and Q3 2018, reaching 140,800.4Palestinian workers in Israel (with and without permits) are even higher.

Due to the downturn in business activity, rising uncertainty, and closures to combat the pandemic, the livelihoods of many families in Palestine are at risk with tens of thousands of families sinking into poverty. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) recently published the results of a survey it had conducted to assess socio-economic changes and found worrying results.1 The survey examined a sample of 9,926 households, and covered the lockdown period of 5 March - 25 May. For some, the economic situation has improved since then as the government eased pandemic-related movement restrictions. While the spread of the virus has been on a downward trend during October, brief local lockdowns have been required in some areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to slow the rate of infection. The assessment of the Spring 2020 lockdown provides important indicators of the perilous impacts of any possible future generalised lockdowns. Work and incomeAccording to the survey results, the main income earners of 14% of Palestinian households ceased working during the lockdown, while 13% were already unemployed prior to the pandemic. The remainder continued to work, however 54% were absent from work during lockdown (unable to work due to lockdown but still employed). The majority (51%) of those who stopped working were from the industrial sector, while 7% were from the agricultural sector. The results do not specify the percentages for other sectors.As a result of the interruption to work during lockdown, only 23% of main income earners who work as wage employees continued to receive their normal wage, 25% received a reduced wage, and 52% received no wage at all (95% of which were in the private sector). The impact was more severe in the West Bank, with 61% of wage employees not receiving any income, compared to 31% in Gaza, where the spread of COVID-19 - and consequently lockdown measures - was much more limited in that period. Due to the decline in work and wages, 42% of households witnessed their income decrease by half or more during lockdown compared to February/March (46% in the West Bank and 38% in Gaza). Almost two thirds (63%) of households could only cover their expenses for a month or less if the lockdown was renewed, and only 10% could cover their expenses for four months or more. The survey also revealed that 58% of Palestinian households usually borrow money or buy on credit to cover household consumption, including food and other basic expenditure. This percentage increased to 63% during the lockdown and as a result, 41% of households decreased their food expenditure compared to February/March.Access to servicesAccording to the PCBS, approximately 4% of households that required health services were unable to access them; 39% of them because the health centres and 1 http://pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_Ar_4-10-2020-covid-ar.pdf Ł Agricultural sector: small-scale farmers should receive subsidies within the next year.

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) expects a $2.5bn (13.5%) decrease in GDP compared to its baseline projection for 2020 assuming that the closures continue until end of May.2 Under this scenario, private and public consumption are expected to decrease by a total of $1.3bn (5.2%), and investment by $2.1bn (43.4%). The PCBS projects that the services sector will be the most affected by the crises, with possible losses of around $1.2bn, followed by the industrial sector ($362), construction ($220m) and agriculture ($200m).The Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) foresees an even larger impact on the economy, using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model that compares two different scenarios.3closure measures would not be fully relaxed before the mid-May, GDP is expected to decline by 20.3%, due to a demand-side shock driven by a decrease in private and public spending (by 21.8% and 15.3% respectively). In the second scenario, which assumes an extension of the closure and gradual recovery for an additional month and a half (until end June), GDP is expected to decline by over 35%, driven by a further decrease in private and public spending (33.2% and 20% respectively). Unemployment is expected to increase from 25% in 20194and to 36.5% in the second.

These estimates are more optimistic than those presented by the PCBS and MAS, largely because they were modeled at an earlier period in the crisis and only focus on major economic aggregates.1 www.corona.ps/2 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_23-4-2020-forc-en.pdf3 MAS Economic Monitor Œ Special Supplement, forthcoming, May 2020, https://bit.ly/2S5mktT 4 https://bit.ly/2ztlpNx5 https://bit.ly/2K9y9uH construction sector might incur if Palestinian workers restrictions on the entry of 65,000 Palestinians working in the Israeli construction sector would lead to delays in the delivery of around 70,000 apartments, which is expected to cause a monthly loss of ILS 4.56 billion ($1.18 billion) in GDP.37As the borders with Jordan and Egypt have been closed for over Palestine is Israel, which has experienced higher transmission rates with 15,782 cases as of 29 April.38 The majority of cases (77%) in the West Bank are among workers returning from Israel,39 with community transmission mostly limited to workers™ families and those who were in direct contact with them.40 The daily overcrowding at crossings and checkpoints, contact with Israeli employers, and daily movement between the West Bank and Israel are all factors that also may be leading to a faster spread of the virus among the workers.41With no control over entry into the West Bank and limited cooperation by Israeli authorities, the GoP is struggling to stop the movement of workers into and out of the West Bank. The Palestinian Ministry of Health deployed testing teams behind Israeli checkpoints, however, systematic tracking has been weak since many workers cross through unmonitored areas.42Workers in Israel are a major source of income for the Palestinian economy, providing subsistence for tens of thousands of families, and stimulating local consumption. 43 The average worker in Israel earns more than double the average wage in the West Bank. In 2019, there were 133,000 Palestinians working in Israel and Israeli settlements, generating $2.55bn in income (15% of GDP).44 ﬁWaqfet Izz™™ FundOn 6 April, the board of the newly founded ﬁWaqfet Izz™™ board, consisting of 30 Palestinian business leaders, began the impact of COVID-19.

On 9 April, the European Union (EU) announced an assistance pandemic.48 The EU welcomed the preventive measures taken so far by the GoP. The assistance package, which also includes humanitarian aid, is a direct response to the GoP™s COVID-19 Response Plan  and commits •49.5m to Healthcare (including six East Jerusalem hospitals), •5.5m to SMEs, •5m to vulnerable communities, and •10,9m for humanitarian aid including UN agencies, UNRWA, and NGOs. On 2 April, the World Bank Group (WBG) approved a new $5m emergency operation to help Palestine address urgent healthcare needs.49 This funding follows a previous reallocation of $800,000 which the World Bank approved on 6 March 2020 as an immediate support to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Other nations have also responded to requests for support. China supplied 10,000 coronavirus testing kits to Palestine, Turkey offered medical assistance to Gaza, and the United States pledged $5m in support.50 March TradingOn 22 March, the Palestine Capital Market Authority (PCMA) suspended trade in Palestine Exchange (PEX), in light of the government™s decision to enforce closure measures.51 On April 21, PCMA decided to resume trading as of 3 May 2020 based on the latest government decision for a gradual lifting of the curfew.52Al-Quds Index witnessed a steady decrease throughout March, falling to 498.9 points (6.6% drop) on the last day of trading.

The delivery of funds is uncertain, especially since the announced resignation of Prime Minister Fayyad and his Government on 7 March and the lack of progress on a National Unity Government. Seven weeks after the military operation, 90% of Gazans still need food aid and many people are in temporary accommodation.  Demand for rental apartments is sky-high, in particular since UNRWA™s schools reopened and children returned to their classes. Rents have risen as much as 150%, according to the local population1. Basic necessities such as cooking gas canisters and washing powder are hard to come by. $4.4bn was pledged for the Palestinian Authority (PA) at the Gaza Reconstruction 2 Among the of $900m (of which $300m will be directed to Gaza reconstruction), $553m from the EU and $42m from the UK. A complete breakdown of pledges is not yet clear. At the conference, the PA asked for $1.6bn to cover the Gaza reconstruction costs and supplementary budget support requirements ($1.15bn for general budget support had already been requested.) A needs assessment for Gaza was presented by the PA at the conference. The plan focused on early re-covery projects and medium-to-longer term reconstruction interventions. ﬁOur goal is not only to restore the pre-war situation in Gaza, but to create a decent standard of living,ﬂ said the Prime Minister, Salam Fayyad.3 Infrastructure (water and sanitation, housing and power networks) and medical and school facilities will be completely rebuilt.

This amount, which will be paid in 48 equal installments, represents the balance of the NIS 2bn debt which the PNA had accumulated over more than a decade, before the parties reached an agreement in September 2016 to restructure relations between the Government of Israel (GoI) and the PNA with respect to electricity provision and consumption.1Under the terms of the 2016 agreement, which aims to position the PNA as the sole body responsible for electricity distribution across the West Bank, the PNA agreed to pay NIS 500m ($132m) of the debt to the IEC immediately, while another NIS 1bn was agreed to be paid in installments. A remaining balance of NIS 500m was permanently erased from the debt.The May agreement, which is currently pending approval by the IEC Board and Israeli regulators, also sets terms for the sale of power to the PETC over the next 15 years and includes collateral and a guarantee mechanism to ensure that the IEC is paid. The agreement provides for the IEC to supply the PETC with NIS 2.8bn ($775m) worth of power transmission annually, via four high-voltage substations that will be built in Jalama, Nablus, Ramallah and Tarqumiya in the coming years by the IEC and the PNA. This arrangement will enable the PETC to take charge of electricity distribution in the West Bank in line with the 2016 agreement.collecting dues from customers across the West Bank and Gaza. Most Palestinian power distribution companies, municipalities and local councils do not pay the full amount for electricity consumed citing high default rates by consumers or high theft rates as the reason for their inability to fully pay the IEC.

The plan, entitled ﬁPeace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli Peopleﬂ (PtP), was announced in two parts.1 The political component was released on 28 January, seven months after the publication of the economic component in June 2019.2 Palestinian political, business and civil society leadership immediately rejected the plan on the grounds that it disregards Palestinian rights to a viable, independent and sovereign state.  sectors.  MAS presented its position paper on the potential implications of the deal, followed by a panel discussion. The economic component of the plan promised $50 billion in new investments over 10 years in Palestine ($28bn), Jordan ($7.5bn), Egypt ($9bn) and Lebanon ($6bn).3 According to the US Administration, successful implementation of the proposed investment plan under PtP would double Palestinian GDP, reduce the unemployment rate to single digits and bring down poverty by half.4 MAS concluded that despite the large sums of promised investment, the Vision poses an existential threat to the viability of the Palestinian economy and constrains the space available for economic activity and investment. Participants highlighted concerns that under the plan Israel will also continue to control all Palestinian water resources (the Dead Sea, Jordan River and groundwater), airspace, cyberspace and trade.

These areas would be separated from the Egyptian border by a narrow area controlled by Israel.6Panelists viewed these aspects as a tightening and institutionalising of the restrictions that are currently imposed on the Palestinian economy. Mr Osama Amer, Secretary of the Private Sector Coordinating Council and a speaker on the panel, reiterated ﬁthe political or economic prospects for Palestinians.ﬂ He explained that the Palestinian economy™s potential gains from the proposed plan ($28bn over 10 years) are negligible when compared to economic gains from ending existing restrictions on the Palestinian C™ cost the economy around $3.4bn annually, while recent UNCTAD estimates put PNA 7 12 www.whitehouse.gov/peacetoprosperity/3 https://bit.ly/2JKMXPJ ; https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/middleeast/peace-plan.html4 www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MEP_programsandprojects.pdf5 www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Peace-to-Prosperity-0120.pdf6 https://bit.ly/3d8mB8s; https://politi.co/33mZoe1  7 https://bit.ly/2vsMpLk; https://bit.ly/3dnvPxL',\n",

This high number illustrates a structural problem in the Palestinian economy which is failing to provide work for highly educated women.In the West Bank the governorates of Tulkarm (28.5%) and Qalqilia (26.0%) had the worst unemployment rates; in Gaza, Rafah had the highest (34.1%).Low labour force participation, at 43.6%, presents another ongoing problem for the labour market and the economy as a whole. Only 39% was recorded in Gaza for Q3. For comparison the rate for both Jordan and Egypt in 2009 was 49%.2 Despite various initiatives documented in previous issues of the Bulletin, women continue to suffer from a disproportionately low participation rate of 16.7% compared to 70.0% for men.3 In Gaza, only 13.2% of women were in the labour force.

This is the second stage of a plan, launched banks to increase their capital from a minimum of $20m to $35m by the end of this year. There are currently 10 local banks and 11 foreign banks operating in the West Bank and 46 in the Gaza Strip. The combined capital of all banks is approximately $900m. All foreign banks, and 26% of local Palestinian banks, of the PMA™s Governor, explained to the Bulletin that if banks are unable to merge with others as part of an effort to rationalise the number of banks™.

Scores will be based on information available on the credit registry system, including a client™s record of borrowing, timely payment of bills and loan history.3 The new system will help banks speed up their credit decisions and enable the PMA to keep track of who is taking credit from different banks.

However, the new license allows the company to install a wider network infrastructure that extends coverage and services throughout the entire area (up to 60% of the territory of the West Bank).2 The installation of such infrastructure will result in Israeli providers to offer Palestinian residents in the West Bank more advanced Israeli cellular services for cheaper prices than available through Palestinian networks, creating a ﬁdigital gapﬂ and unfair competition between the Palestinian and Israeli telecommunications sectors.The Government of Israel (GoI) currently limits Palestinian access to the electromagnetic sphere, and controls imports of ICT equipment.3 Granting Bezeq the license to operate fully and legally on Palestinian land, while denying Palestinian telecommunication companies from expanding their networks in Area C, leaves Palestinian residents with no alternatives to Israeli service providers.4 This includes up to 300,000 Palestinians living in those areas, and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who commute through Area C on a daily basis.5 Palestinian telecom companies are prohibited from building switches6 in Area A, which is supposed to be under sole PA control under the Oslo accords.7The Palestinian Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology (MTIT) condemned the GoI™s decision, describing it as a ﬁcontinuation of the occupation of the Palestinian economyﬂ. MTIT added that Israeli operators held 16% of the West Bank market share in 2019, with the number of Palestinian subscribers reaching one million this year.8incurred a consequent revenue loss of around $63m in 2019. Furthermore, Israeli telecommunication companies operate with impunity whilst ignoring the basic mandatory operational legalities such as obtaining licenses and paying fees and taxes to the Palestinian Government. The World Bank estimated that Palestinian telecom companies incurred total revenue losses between $436m and $1.1bn in the period 2013-2015 alone, with the direct impact of the occupation equivalent to 3% of the GDP at the time.9Authority was estimated at between $70m and $184m in the period 2013-2015.Despite such limitations, the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector is among the fastest growing sectors in Palestine. In the last two decades, the ICT sector grew by over 250%, hiring approximately 6,760 workers in 2018.

The Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Israeli Government agreed in May 2008 that Israel would release the necessary frequencies for Wataniya Mobile operations and services. The Quartet Representative said at the time, ﬁthe Government of Israel  has agreed to [–] release a frequency of 2.4 MHz in the 900 bandwidth. The Government of Israel will commit, in writing, that within 6 to 8 months, the assignment of frequency will be amended to a total bandwidth of 4.8 MHz at the 900/1800 MHz bands and will assign a frequency of more than 4.8 MHz in due course, 1 To date the necessary frequencies have not been released.Wataniya Mobile planned to launch their mobile service provision in April 2009. Allan Richardson, CEO of Wataniya Mobile said that Wataniya has been unable to launch its operations because Israel had not abided by the frequency agreement. He added that some of the company™s essential equipment remains held up at Israeli Customs.The Palestinian Minister of Telecommunications and Information Technology (MTIT), Dr. Mashhour Abu Daka, told the Bulletin that Israel is pushing Jawwal and Wataniya to use a 1,800MH frequency and abandon the 900MH frequency. However, 900MH is more cost effective and has a wider coverage area than 1,800MH. This range requires fewer materials for installation (towers, cables etc.) and incurs fewer overall costs. Telecommunications companies on the whole prefer 900MH for 3G services. If Wataniya does secure a frequency and Jawwal also shifts to using 1800MH, the Israeli telecommunications companies, still operating at 900MH, will be able to offer more affordable and better services. ‚Israel is acting in a way that is contrary to supporting an open market economy, working to strengthen the competitive advantage of the Israeli telecommunications companies as two new regional companies enter the Palestinian market™, Abu Daka added.The withdrawal of Wataniya would put the PA in a critical situation. It could lose $354m which was paid by Wataniya Mobile for license fees, and another $200m in expenses spent on installing equipment and running costs. 3,000 jobs would be lost.2 The international community is continuing to put pressure on Israel to facilitate Palestinian telecommunications sector expansion,3 and the release of frequences and equipment.1 See: l 2 See: http://www.9 3 See: http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE55F3RR20090616 The joint Palestinian-Israeli economic committee is expected to reconvene before the end of July, after years of inaction.

Amr Hamd, Gaza General Manager of the Palestinian Federation of Industries, explained that the lack of liquidity in the banks in Gaza is prohibiting companies from meeting commercial agreements. Cash is not available in the banks and the vast majority of businessmen cannot leave Gaza or transfer money to or from Israel or the West Bank. Money transfers from banks in Gaza to Israel require special permission which is almost impossible to attain. Hamd said that around NIS 50m passes into the Gaza Strip every month or so. The Bank of Palestine told the Bulletin that an individual can bring up to $10,000 cash into Gaza. However, since only a handful of businessmen are able to travel in and out of Gaza, this does not amount to much. According to the Bank of Palestine and Arab Bank, there are no pre-set daily limits for withdrawals. Private and public sector salaries in Gaza are paid in Israeli shekels (NIS), (about two thirds of the total employed in Gaza), while UNRWA and foreign institutions pay salaries in US$. Jordanian Dinars (JD) are also used but to a lesser extent. However this month US$ and JD are in greater demand than NIS. Hamd suggested this may be largely related to UNRWA, which brings in and distributes most of the US$ in Gaza, through employee salaries, cash assistance for its job creation programme and the remaining damage costs for refugees affected by the recent hostilities. This month UNWRA has not brought as many dollars into Gaza as it has done in the past. Shokri Karaz, Branch Manager of Arab Bank in Gaza, told the Bulletin that the lack of dollars and JD in Gaza™s banks is greatly impacting spending patterns, affecting building projects and wedding plans alike. Karaz explained that when cash is available, customers tend to take out as much future of the banks.The almost total closure of Gaza™s borders and the liquidity crisis are affecting exchange rates.

This includes the expansion of Israeli settlements and outposts in the West Bank, developing infrastructure to connect the settlements to Israel, restrictions on Palestinian construction and demolitions in Area C under Israeli military control.5 The move under discussion would deepen the existing reality on the ground and provide a legal framework for it, making it ﬁde jure annexationﬂ.6economically viable Palestinian State.

He suggestions to resume contact in order to transfer clearance revenues, noting that Israel could transfer the funds without direct contact.39The PNA also expressed its stance to international donor partners through a statement to the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC). The statement stated that annexation would violate Palestinians™ basic rights, deprive them of sovereignty over their natural resources, undermine the territorial unity of the Palestinian territories, and cause detriment to the two-state solution. The PNA called upon all States to recognise the State of Palestine with pre-1967 borders, adopt measures of accountability (such as sanctions), and work towards ending the Israeli occupation of areas occupied since 1967.40On 21 June, Hussein al-Sheikh told Israel™s public radio Kan that the PNA and Palestinian security forces will collapse if Israel proceeds with its annexation plan.4134 http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=37R4Uca117299750238a37R4Uc35 https://wapo.st/2YALva4 36 https://bit.ly/30VFIPv 37 https://nyti.ms/311GWsz 38 consists of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia, with a mandate to assist in mediating Middle East peace negotiations while supporting Palestinian economic development and institution building39 https://bit.ly/2CaNLxt 40 www.lacs.ps/documentsShow.aspx?ATT_ID=4526441 www.al-ayyam.ps/ar_page.php?id=13f99938y335124792Y13f99938  International ResponseInternational responses to potential annexation have been largely critical, with most nations and organisations denouncing the decision and urging that it be reconsidered.

       " 'september-2015.pdf': 'The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC BULLETINMain reportsIssue 108September 2015Economic Assessments The Government of Palestine1 and the IMF2 issued reports assessing the current state of and prospects for the Palestinian economy. According to the IMF, the economic outlook for the West Bank and Gaza for the remainder of 2015 is challenging and subject to considerable risks. Assuming there is no change in restrictions and/or security conditions, the IMF projects growth in the West Bank to slow to 1.8% by year end, from 5% in 2014. According to the IMF, the expected drop reßects the impact of increased uncertainty on private demand and reduced growth in Israel. In Gaza, a rebound of 6.5% is expected, assuming continued reconstruction activity. Real GDP growth for the Palestinian economy is therefore projected at 2.9%, implying stagnant per capita GDP given the high rate of population growth. Inßation is projected to remain low, at less than 2%. The main risks to the outlook relate to heightened political and security tensions and a related lower than expected rebound in private investment and Þscal slippages. The latter include revenue shortfalls, lower donor aid, and the inability of the PNA to withstand spending pressures.The IMF estimates that in the medium term, absent a political breakthrough, growth will remain below what is needed to durably reduce unemployment and improve living standards (Figure 1). Under a baseline scenario assuming political status quo and unchanged Israeli restrictions, some decline in aid after the completion of Gaza reconstruction, and limited policy actions on the part of the PNA, growth is expected to hover around 3%, with a rise in unemployment. A further deterioration in the political landscape or aid shortfalls would produce even worse economic outcomes. On the other hand, the IMF points out that even in the absence of a political breakthrough, improvements in Israeli-Palestinian economic cooperation could prove beneÞcial.Figure 1: GDP growth and projections (2012 - 2020)-15-10-5051015West BankGaza StripPalestine201220132014201520162017201820192020Source: IMF1 www.ldf.ps/documentsShow.aspx?ATT_ID=219792 www.imf.org/external/country/WBG/RR/2015/092115.pdfIn September, the new Palestinian city of Rawabi welcomed its Þrst residents, 2,000 people are expected to live there by the end of yearBetween 14 and 16 September, Þve leading Palestinian companies from the stone and marble sector participated at ‚The Big 5 Kuwait™, the country™s largest international construction eventThe Current Account deÞcit (totaling $372.7m in Q2 2015) increased by 15.2% compared to the previous quarterA recent report by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development suggests that that Gaza ﬁcould become uninhabitable by 2020 due to ongoing de-development, eight years of economic blockade and three military operations in the past six yearsﬂThe Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

Two decades of instability have resulted in a pattern of declining GDP per capita, high unemployment and continued deterioration of Gaza™s historically strong productive sectors. The energies of government and business must be directed towards sustainable development, with the private sector at its heart. Creating a longer-term vision for a stable, connected and thriving Gaza can help guide shorter-term interventions.

The decrease was mainly driven by a loss of 20,500 jobs in Gaza and 11,200 jobs in Israel and Israeli settlements during the same period. The labour force participation rate for Palestine remained relatively unchanged in Q2 2017 (45.4%) when compared to Q1 2017 (45.8%) and Q2 2016 (45.7%). The major difference between the female participation rate (particularly low at 18.5%) and the male participation rate (71.6%) persisted. The wide gap in unemployment by gender also remained, as female unemployment reached 50%, compared to 23.7% for males. The situation was more pronounced in Gaza, where female unemployment amounted to 71.5%, compared to 36.2% for males. In the West Bank, the unemployment rate for females was 36.2%, compared to 16.8% for males.Another persistent trend is youth unemployment, with 46.3% of those aged 20-24 years and 39.2% of those aged 25-29 years unemployed in Q2 2017. Among female youth, the unemployment rate reached 72.7% for those aged 20-24 years and 69.1% for those aged 25-29 years. The most educated Palestinian women (13+ years of schooling) also face a high unemployment rate at 57.4%, despite exhibiting a relatively high labour force participation rate (46.7%). This is a particularly worrisome trend as it could discourage women from pursuing higher education.1 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_7-8-2017-LF-en.pdf  The Palestine Monetary Authority Business Cycle Index (PMABCI) deteriorated to -4.3 points in August 2017, from 0.3 points in the previous monthAccording to data recently released by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in goods reached $1,034m in Q2 2017, an increase of 1.6% from Q1 2017The Palestine Investment Fund (PIF) announced on 30 August 2017, the commencement of the construction of the Al-Nuaima Solar Power Station in the Jericho and Jordan Valley GovernorateAppMahal, a Palestinian mobile application developer, completed a $4m Series B Fund Management Company The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

This tension has been compounded by the lack of agreed communication channels on economic issues between the two sides. Under the Paris Economic Protocol signed in 1994, a Palestinian-Israeli Joint Economic Committee (JEC) was established to follow up the implementation of the agreement and to arbitrate issues related to the economy.2 However, the Committee has been inactive since the early 2000s despite some attempts to reactivate it.3 The recent partial resolution of the 2019 clearance revenue dispute between the PNA and Israel was supposed to include the reconvening of some technical committees within the JEC framework and a reconsideration of the Paris Protocol, but no progress has since been announced on these issues.Halting Import of Calves from IsraelOn 28 October, Riyad Atari, the Palestinian Minister of Agriculture, announced that the Israeli authorities had approved the import of 10,700 calves to Palestine from abroad, through Palestinian traders. He stated that 1,680 calves will be imported in the next few days, and the remainder gradually introduced into the market in batches until mid-November.4Palestine imports around 120,000 calves from Israel annually; 20,000 from Israeli farms, and 100,000 from Israeli traders importing from abroad.5 On 16 September, Atari announced the Government™s plan to halt all calf imports from Israel or from Israeli importers, and he called upon all regulatory bodies to follow up on implementation.6 The Government™s announcement came as part of its wider economic disengagement policy, whereby Palestinians would be able to import calves directly from abroad through Palestinian traders rather than through Israeli importers or from Israeli farms.However, the GoI has meanwhile threatened to halt the entry of Palestinian agricultural products (approximately 280-300 tons per day) into the Israeli market if a ﬁboycottﬂ of livestock imports from Israel is pursued.7 The Palestinian Government has since sources of imports.8 Palestinian traders have informed the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture that the Gol and the Israeli veterinary department have held up clearance health standards, which will result in a 25-day delay to complete necessary health checks.9 The GoI also rescinded Businessman Cards (BMCs)10 of Palestinian direct 1 http://palestinecabinet.gov.ps/Website/AR/ViewDetails?ID=437252 www.paltrade.org/upload/agreements/Paris%20Economic%20Protocol.pdf3 https://bit.ly/2rVbpZy 4 www.alhadath.ps/article/108478/5 www.alhadath.ps/article/108478/ 6 www.palestineeconomy.ps/ar/Article/154827 www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-israel-palestinian-authority-economy-boycott-1.79912568 https://bit.ly/32gFgIC9 quarantine is usually 8 days; https://bit.ly/35i7lRD 10 A magnetic permit that allows a limited number of Palestinian business executives to move between the Palestinian Territories and Israel.

The two institutions project medium-term growth in real GDP income given the projected population growth. Once again, the World Bank and the IMF stressed the need for revived efforts by all relevant parties (the Palestinian National Authority Œ PNA, the Government of Israel Œ GoI and international donors) to reduce the pressure on the PNA™s budget, to support the reconstruction of Gaza and to renew the peace process.According to the World Bank, ﬁPolitical instability and the long lasting restrictions on movement, access and trade are the main impediments to economic growthﬂ in resulted in the ﬁdeindustrializationﬂ of the Palestinian economy - with the share of manufacturing in GDP dropping from 18% in 1995 to around 10% in 2015. The share of agriculture in the economy has also decreased to 50% of what it was in 1995. The World Bank also states that whilst the Palestinian economy will not be able to reach its potential until a permanent peace agreement has been established, there is much that can be done. One of the key constraints to economic growth continues to be Israeli restrictions on Palestinian access to Area C.  A 2014 World Bank study suggested that unrestricted Palestinian economic activity in Area C, including the exploitation of its natural resources, could increase GDP by as much as 35% and create thousands of jobs, primarily through growth in the agricultural sector and Dead Sea minerals processing industries.2 The importance of Area C for economic development was emphasized by the members of the AHLC during a recent meeting in New York. The AHLC also stressed that further reforms by the Palestinian Government are required to improve the economic conditions, with particular attention to competitiveness and the business climate.According to the World Bank, reforms to improve the business climate could also help support the Palestinian economy, with efforts needed on four priority areas. First, there is a need to reform the current legislation governing business, as it currently is a mixture of Ottoman, British Mandate, Jordanian, Egyptian and Palestinian laws, in addition to Israeli Military Orders. This has created many internal inconsistencies in the rules governing business activity in Palestine.

The Statement indicates that the increase has been mainly assets (especially by local government). The Government has managed to maintain a stable level of current expenditure by decreasing its expenditure on employees™ compensation (around a 9% drop in absolute terms between 2014 and 2015). This decrease could be attributed to the PNA™s active effort to stabilize the wage bill.

I believe this will help put Palestine on the global map and is recognition of the high professionalism of our organization.  My goal as the President of IAOS is to strengthen the organization through better engagement with its members. My strategy for achieving this includes four that the work of IAOS is relevant to its members and to other peer organizations. Second, maintain visibility at statistical events to maintain an appropriate role in global statistical directions. Third, build new partnerships and develop existing ones so IAOS can better serve the global statistical community. Finally, institutionalize the work of IAOS so that in the future the organization can focus on developmental issues rather than managerial matters.has been elected as the president of IAOS and such an opportunity is a golden one. It will assist in shedding light on how data is being produced under challenging circumstances, which are no longer limited to Palestine but are being faced by various countries within the region such as Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Yemen, and Libya. Such data is of high importance since it can help show what is happening on the ground and what interventions should be mobilized.I aim to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries in several international priorities such as moving from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The trade challenges are on the supply side. Exports include olive oil, stone and marble and furniture and constitute 7% of GDP, when the average for lower middle-income countries is 17%.The main developmental problems are trade policy having been conditioned by the Paris Protocol and national developmental plans never prioritising trade policy. The latter is changing as the new national strategy gives more attention to trade policy. With regards to industrial policies, all efforts have been focused on improving the business only 81 manufacturing companies employing more than 50 workers. Most of the economy is comprised of family-run micro and small enterprises with a high proportion of family workers. Who are Palestine™s key strategic trade partners and what is the way forward to enhance trade with them?Palestine is exporting around $10m to Europe per year, $5m to the US and practically nothing to Canada although we have free market access. The most utilised agreement is the Greater Arab Free Trade Agreement (GAFTA). The problem is that there is no supply-side capacity. Palestine does not have the products which the world market is demanding. You cannot export what you produce; you should export what the world wants. Even in GAFTA, 67% of the increase in exports is due to olive oil, stone and marble. The way forward is to look at what the world wants and what of that Palestine can produce and then implement industrial policies to develop those sectors.What is the optimal trade regime under the current circumstances?Soon our project will present a proposal of trade policy for Palestine, including a tariff component. In a study that will be published by MAS soon, we are analysing what would be the most appropriate tariff policy. What is clear is that the Paris Protocol arrangements are completely dysfunctional for the Palestinian economy. The tariff schedule adequate for Israel is not adequate for Palestine, which needs to use tariffs as an instrument of industrial policy Œ to lower the cost of some inputs and protect sectors that have potential. It is the typical ﬁinfant industryﬂ argument. New companies need time to become competitive. WTO? What are the next steps towards its realisation?Palestine is de facto implementing all WTO obligations, because of the Paris Protocol and because Israel is a is the availability of the dispute settlement mechanism, a forum where small countries can defend their interests. Another one is that the WTO agreements are international best practices in many areas, such as technical standards and trade facilitation for the private sector, so being a member would allow Palestine to put its house in order.before starting accession negotiations, which last up to ten years. Palestine requested an observer status in 2009, but no action was taken. Now the Government is exploring the possibility of presenting another request.

       " 'january-2017.pdf': 'The Portland TrustPage 1/4Page 4/4Bulletin Special Feature  January 2017PAYING FOR SUCCESS: SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT IMPACT BONDSINTRODUCTIONPalestine needs new ways of tackling some persistent and costly social problems such as high levels of unemployment, large numbers of young people that are neither in education or employment, and high rates of preventable deaths from chronic diseases such as diabetes. Government, the private sector and civil society organisations are under increasing pressure to help tackle these problems, in a context of declining levels of aid. Social impact investment is one tool that governments all over the world are using to solve enduring social and economic problems youth unemployment (UK) and supporting small scale farmers (Peru).Impact investments can have greatest impact when funding is linked to outcomes. Traditionally, commissioners prescribe and pay for a particular service that they believe will lead to a desired social outcome, known as a ‚fee for service™ contract. However, commissioners are moving towards funding approaches that pay on the basis of outcomes (e.g. reduced unemployment) rather than activities (session In a DIB, investors are repaid by non-government parties such as aid agencies and philanthropists. DIBs, therefore, are part of an effort to apply and adapt SIBs to international development. For this reason, use of outcomes contracts in Palestine may initially be driven by DIBs.This note looks at how impact bonds have been used around the world and sets out how DIBs could best be applied in Palestine. It is organised as follows:In theory - what are impact bonds and why are they useful?In practice Œ when are they useful and at what scale?Next steps - actions to accelerate the use of DIBs in Palestine.Outcomes ContractAny contract between a government and a service provider that involves some element of payment for outcomes achieved, also known as Payment by Results (PbR).CommissionerAny government, donor or foundation with responsibility for buying service provision (typically from an external provider).Social Impact Bond (SIB)Any arrangement made by a service provider to access off-InvestorThe role of the investor in a SIB or DIB contract is to provide funds upfront for services, to be repaid if outcomes are achieved.Development Impact Bond (DIB)The DIB is conceptually the same as a SIB, but non-government parties (such as aid agencies and philanthropists) pay for the outcomes delivered instead of the government.Outcomes FunderThe role of the outcomes funder in a SIB or DIB contract is to have been achieved.use in Palestine remains embryonic. Four priority actions could accelerate the use of DIBs in Palestine:1.Provide support for capacity building for service providers.Services providers, especially early adopters, may requireadditional resources to perform under an outcomes contract,compared to contracting on a pure fee for service basis. Forexample, service providers have to be able to demonstratetheir impact and that they can take on additional funds andscale up their activities. They also have to possess requisitebusiness planning competences to reassure investors thatmoney will be spent judiciously. Grants and business supportcould be made available on a rolling basis to help supportinvestment and bid for outcomes contracts.In the U.S., the Social Innovation Fund Pay for SuccessInitiative awarded over $20m to support feasibility andtechnical assistance for SIBs. More than 50 service providersare currently using federal funds to explore feasibility orsupport project development.  Grants have increasinglyfocused on building the enabling infrastructure for suchprojects, especially cross-system data sharing.  To date, 15SIB transactions have closed in the U.S.2.Support coordination and collaboration between donors.Donors can play the role of either investor or market builderor both. The Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) of the Inter-American Development Bank has allocated $5.3m to exploreSIBs across Latin America. The programme offers support forthe design of and investment in SIBs, including by creatinglocal capabilities amongst governments and other parties.with the goal of lifting poor, female-head households out ofpoverty. The State of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and the Municipalityof Buenos Aires (Argentina) are also receiving MIF™s supportfor the development of SIBs.The fragmentation of public spending across differentgovernment departments and authorities can makeUK Government establishing its Social Outcomes FinanceFund, which acts as an additional central funding streamand encourages different departments to contribute to SIBprojects. In Palestine, this could be addressed by donorscollectively creating a fund to contribute to outcome payments for DIBs.To date, the UK has allocated nearly £200m for outcomes funds. In the U.S., the Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for ResultsAct would establish a $300 million outcomes fund, housedapproved by the House of Representatives.  It is expected topass the House again in early 2017, with supporters hopeful for Senate passage.3.Improve metrics.  Outcomes measurement and evaluation arekey issues for SIBs and DIBs and may require additional skills to those required to contract on a fee for service basis. Building an evidence base of costs would help commissioners assess howmuch they would be willing to pay for outcomes. In 2013, theUK Government published a Unit Cost Database, a free onlineresource to facilitate SIB development which provides detailed National Advisory Board on Impact Investing provided apractical guide to understanding social costs, including applied examples on teen parenthood and homelessness.9 The NewSouth Wales Government has also committed to publishing unit cost data as part of their strategy.10Work in this area could build on existing efforts to developeffective performance management, such as OpenRBF (a tool11 and a standardized tool to cost early childhood interventions.124.Support awareness and knowledge sharing and information.terminology can be confusing.  The partnerships, the datacollection, setting metrics and payment mechanisms canbe new to commissioners and service providers and requireexplanation. These issues could be addressed by providingonline information and resources relevant to DIBs. Forfor Social Impact Bonds as a central resource for knowledgeand best practice for central and local government, deliverypartners, investors and intermediaries.At the global level, The Global Social Impact InvestmentSteering Group (GSG) was established in August 2015 asthe successor to the Social Impact Investment Taskforceestablished by the G8.

The most recent data reveals GDP growth of only 0.5% in Gaza during 2017. Unemployment reached 44% during the same period, despite a low labour participation rate of 75% for males and 18% for females. The quality of life for most Gaza residents is deteriorating, especially as access to basic utilities and services has continued to decline.1 Electricity ShortageBy 6 February 2018, emergency electricity generators ran out of fuel in three out of Gaza™s 13 hospitals and 14 out of its 54 medical centres.2 On 14 February, the Gaza supply of diesel fuel required to operate the plant.3 The possibility of additional medical facilities shutting down due to the lack of electricity was averted through a $3.5m donation towards emergency fuel supplies from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and the State of Qatar. The donation covers 54% of the $6.5m required for the most critical medical facilities to continue their operations in 2018.4While the GPP™s total capacity is 140 MW, since 22 January 2018, it has produced at most 25 MW of electricity.

Real GDP is expected to increase by 0.5% and the GDP per capita to decrease by 2%. The unemployment rate is expected to stay high, at 31.5% in 2019. The Optimistic Scenario4 assumes an improved political and economic situation that allows for real GDP to increase by 5% during 2019 and GDP per capita to increase by 2%. Unemployment would fall back to 2017 levels of 29% during 2019. The Pessimistic Scenario,5 assumes a deteriorating political and economic situation where GDP is projected to decrease by 3% during 2019 and GDP per capita would decrease by 5%. The number of Palestinian employees in Israel would decrease by 12%, thus increasing unemployment to 33%.The PMA™s separate forecasting exercise largely corresponds to the projections of the PCBS. Despite the different methodologies and modelling techniques employed, both forecasts agree on the range of possible GDP outcomes and are 6 However, in the baseline scenario, PMA™s forecasts project slightly higher real GDP and per capita GDP growth prospects, based on its expectation that the same challenges constraining economic growth in 2018 would continue. Furthermore, the range between the PMA™s worst and best outlook is narrower than that forecasted by PCBS.1 Given the limitations in obtaining economic data from Gaza, the forcasts do not allow separate modelling of the West Bank and Gazan economies.2 www.pcbs.gov.ps/post.aspx?lang=en&ItemID=3341 3budget, declining clearance revenues from Israel, increased government transfers, income tax collection and value of credit facilities, continuing restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries and population growth (birth and mortality rates) in Palestine remaining at current levels.4 Optimistic scenario economic and political assumptions based on political reconciliation between the West Bank and Gaza, reconstruction of Gaza and donor support for Government budget, increased clearance revenues increased development expenditure, decreased restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries, and population  (birth and mortality rates) growth below current levels.5 Pessimistic scenario economic and political assumptions based on decreased donor support for Government clearance value added taxes, decrease in income tax collection, and a decrease in development expenditures, increased restrictions on movement of people/goods inside Palestine, between regions, and with neighboring countries and the number of workers in Israel decreasing.6The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) published its preliminary estimates on the performance of the Palestinian Economy in 2018The Private Sector Coordination Council calls for an emergency economic development programme for GazaOn 23 December 2018, the PCBS published its Balance of Payments and International Investment Position reports for the third quarter of 2018On an annual basis, the Al-Quds index decreased by 7.9% compared to the last day of trading in 2017The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

The PCBS has estimated that the unemployment rate reached 28.5% during 2017, an increase from 27.3% in 2016.6 7 This estimate is higher than the December 2016 baseline scenario forecasts by the PCBS (27.2%) and the PMA (27.6%).Despite the worrying political and economic prospects, there were a number of positive developments in the Palestinian economy during 2017.8Strategic ProjectsDuring 2017, the Palestinian private sector led by Palestine™s national sovereign fund, the Palestine Investment Fund (PIF), commenced three strategic projects which aim to reduce resource-dependency on Israel and achieve energy security.plant in Jenin, with a total investment of over $600m and a capacity of 450 MW. The construction of the plant, which began in 2017, is expected to be completed by June 2020.9In November 2017, Massader Company, PIF™s investment subsidiary for energy and infrastructure, launched the Tubas Solar Power Plant, an $11 million investment to bring 8 MW of solar capacity to the residential, agricultural and industrial sectors in the Tubas Governorate.10In a joint project, the PIF and the Jordanian Manaseer Group are leading the investment of around $310m. Construction began in 2017 and is expected to be completed during 2018. The factory is expected to eventually produce enough cement to cover all the needs of the Palestinian market. Currently 90% of cement used in Palestine is imported from Israel and the remaining 10% comes from different countries (mainly Jordan and Egypt) for a total import bill of $300m per year.111 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_GDP-28-12-2017-en.pdf2 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_forca-26-12-2017-en.pdf3 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_28-3-2017-NA-en.pdf4 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_EcoForeCast2017E.pdf5 http://bit.ly/2n4gnNs6 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_forca-26-12-2017-en.pdf7 www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_9-11-2017-LFS-en.pdf8 http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=n1fuNia95855803395an1fuNi9 http://bit.ly/2mNdeBx10 www.pif.ps/page.php?id=ae99y44697Yae9911 http://bit.ly/2rgEmhdPalestinian Prime Minister Dr. Rami Hamdallah and the Japanese Foreign Minister, Mr. Taro Kono, launched the second phase of the development of the Jericho Agro-Industrial Park (on 26 December 2017.The United States Government announced on 16 January 2018 that it would with-hold $65m out of a $125m aid instalment earmarked for the UNRWA.In response to a request from the PNA, the Government of Israel announced on 7 January 2018 the restoration of 50 MW of power to Gaza effective as of 8 January 2018.The Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education announced on 31 December 2017 the disbursement of NIS 6.12m ($1.8m) to local universities to The Palestinian Economic Bulletin is prepared by the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) and edited by The Portland Trust.

This amount, which will be paid in 48 equal installments, represents the balance of the NIS 2bn debt which the PNA had accumulated over more than a decade, before the parties reached an agreement in September 2016 to restructure relations between the Government of Israel (GoI) and the PNA with respect to electricity provision and consumption.1Under the terms of the 2016 agreement, which aims to position the PNA as the sole body responsible for electricity distribution across the West Bank, the PNA agreed to pay NIS 500m ($132m) of the debt to the IEC immediately, while another NIS 1bn was agreed to be paid in installments. A remaining balance of NIS 500m was permanently erased from the debt.The May agreement, which is currently pending approval by the IEC Board and Israeli regulators, also sets terms for the sale of power to the PETC over the next 15 years and includes collateral and a guarantee mechanism to ensure that the IEC is paid. The agreement provides for the IEC to supply the PETC with NIS 2.8bn ($775m) worth of power transmission annually, via four high-voltage substations that will be built in Jalama, Nablus, Ramallah and Tarqumiya in the coming years by the IEC and the PNA. This arrangement will enable the PETC to take charge of electricity distribution in the West Bank in line with the 2016 agreement.collecting dues from customers across the West Bank and Gaza. Most Palestinian power distribution companies, municipalities and local councils do not pay the full amount for electricity consumed citing high default rates by consumers or high theft rates as the reason for their inability to fully pay the IEC.

The decrease was mainly driven by a loss of 20,500 jobs in Gaza and 11,200 jobs in Israel and Israeli settlements during the same period. The labour force participation rate for Palestine remained relatively unchanged in Q2 2017 (45.4%) when compared to Q1 2017 (45.8%) and Q2 2016 (45.7%). The major difference between the female participation rate (particularly low at 18.5%) and the male participation rate (71.6%) persisted. The wide gap in unemployment by gender also remained, as female unemployment reached 50%, compared to 23.7% for males. The situation was more pronounced in Gaza, where female unemployment amounted to 71.5%, compared to 36.2% for males. In the West Bank, the unemployment rate for females was 36.2%, compared to 16.8% for males.Another persistent trend is youth unemployment, with 46.3% of those aged 20-24 years and 39.2% of those aged 25-29 years unemployed in Q2 2017. Among female youth, the unemployment rate reached 72.7% for those aged 20-24 years and 69.1% for those aged 25-29 years. The most educated Palestinian women (13+ years of schooling) also face a high unemployment rate at 57.4%, despite exhibiting a relatively high labour force participation rate (46.7%).

The trade challenges are on the supply side. Exports include olive oil, stone and marble and furniture and constitute 7% of GDP, when the average for lower middle-income countries is 17%.The main developmental problems are trade policy having been conditioned by the Paris Protocol and national developmental plans never prioritising trade policy. The latter is changing as the new national strategy gives more attention to trade policy. With regards to industrial policies, all efforts have been focused on improving the business only 81 manufacturing companies employing more than 50 workers. Most of the economy is comprised of family-run micro and small enterprises with a high proportion of family workers. Who are Palestine™s key strategic trade partners and what is the way forward to enhance trade with them?Palestine is exporting around $10m to Europe per year, $5m to the US and practically nothing to Canada although we have free market access. The most utilised agreement is the Greater Arab Free Trade Agreement (GAFTA). The problem is that there is no supply-side capacity. Palestine does not have the products which the world market is demanding. You cannot export what you produce; you should export what the world wants. Even in GAFTA, 67% of the increase in exports is due to olive oil, stone and marble. The way forward is to look at what the world wants and what of that Palestine can produce and then implement industrial policies to develop those sectors.What is the optimal trade regime under the current circumstances?Soon our project will present a proposal of trade policy for Palestine, including a tariff component. In a study that will be published by MAS soon, we are analysing what would be the most appropriate tariff policy. What is clear is that the Paris Protocol arrangements are completely dysfunctional for the Palestinian economy. The tariff schedule adequate for Israel is not adequate for Palestine, which needs to use tariffs as an instrument of industrial policy Œ to lower the cost of some inputs and protect sectors that have potential. It is the typical ﬁinfant industryﬂ argument. New companies need time to become competitive. WTO? What are the next steps towards its realisation?Palestine is de facto implementing all WTO obligations, because of the Paris Protocol and because Israel is a is the availability of the dispute settlement mechanism, a forum where small countries can defend their interests. Another one is that the WTO agreements are international best practices in many areas, such as technical standards and trade facilitation for the private sector, so being a member would allow Palestine to put its house in order.before starting accession negotiations, which last up to ten years. Palestine requested an observer status in 2009, but no action was taken. Now the Government is exploring the possibility of presenting another request. The project has supported the MoNE in that endeavor, and it is now a political decision.')"
